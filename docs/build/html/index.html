<p>PsyNeuLink is a &#8220;block modeling system&#8221; for cognitive neuroscience.  Block modeling systems allow components to be
constructed that implement various, possibly disparate functions, and then link them together into a system to
examine how they interact.  In PsyNeuLink, components are used to implement the function of brain subsystems and/or
psychological processes, the interaction of which can then be simulated at the system level.</p>
<p>PsyNeuLink is open source, and meant to be extended. Its goal is to provide an environment for implementing models
of mind/brain function that are modular, customizable, extensible, disseminable, and clearly documented.  It does this
in a manner that:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>is <em>computationally general</em> —&nbsp;that is, that can implement any desired mechanism or process;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>adheres as closely as possible to the insights and design principles that have been learned in computer science
(e.g., function-based, object-oriented programming);</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>expresses (as few as possible) <em>commitments</em> that reflect general principles of how the brain/mind is organized
and operates, without committing to any particular model or theory;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>expresses these commitments in a form that is powerful, easy to use, and familiar to cognitive neuroscientists;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">allows models to be simply and flexibly implemented, using a minimum of coding, and that provides seamless
integration of, and interaction among disparate components that can vary in their:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>granularity of representation and function</li>
<li>time-scale of operation</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>provides a standard and accessible environment for model comparison, sharing, and documentation;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li>interface (API) can easily be constructed to other powerful tools for implementing individual components, such as:<ul>
<li>MatLab (general purpose mathematical tools);</li>
<li>TensorFlow, Teano (ODE&#8217;s, deep learning);</li>
<li>Emergent (broad class of neurally-plausible connectionist models);</li>
<li>ACT-R (sybmolic, production system models).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The goal is to encourage users to think about information processing in a &#8220;mind/brain-like&#8221; way, while imposing as few
constraints as possible on what it is possible to implement or ask the model to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-psyneulink-is-not">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>What PsyNeuLink is <strong>NOT</strong><a class="headerlink" href="#what-psyneulink-is-not" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PsyNeuLink is not presently well suited to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>extensive model fitting</li>
<li>large scale simulations</li>
<li>elaborate and detailed models of a particular form</li>
<li>biophysically-realistic models of individual neurons</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Other packages that are much better for such applications are:
<a class="reference external" href="https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page">Emergent</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org">TensorFlow</a> (for neural network models);
<a class="reference external" href="http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/">HDDM</a> (for Drift Diffusion Models);
<a class="reference external" href="http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu">ACT-R</a> (for production system models);
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.genesis-sim.org">Genesis</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">Neuron</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nengo.ca">Nengo</a>  (for biophysically-realistic models of neuronal function).</p>
<p>These packages are all better for elaborate and detailed models of a particular form.
In contrast, the initial efforts in the design and implementation of PsyNeuLink have been put into making it as
flexible and easy to use as possible, including its ability to integrate components constructed in other packages
(includling some of the ones listed above).  These are characteristics that are often (at least in the initial
stages of development) in tension with efficiency (think:  interpreted vs. compiled).  As PsyNeuLink grows and matures,
our expectation is that effort will be put into making it more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<span id="id3"></span><h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PsyNeuLink is written in Python, and conforms to the syntax and (most of the) coding standards for the language.
The primary constructs in PsyNeuLink are mechanisms, projections, processes, and systems.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="Mechanism.html"><span class="doc">Mechanisms</span></a>.  A PsyNeuLink mechanism takes an input, transforms it with a function in some way, and makes the
output available to other mechanisms. Its primary purpose is representational transformation (that is, &#8220;information
processing&#8221;). Mechanisms can take any form of input, use any function, and generate any form of
output.  PsyNeuLink provides mechanisms with standard functions (e.g., linear and logistic transforms for scalars and
arrays;  integrator functions, including various forms of drift diffusion processes; and matrix algebraic functions).
However a mechanism can easily be customized with any function that can be written in or called from Python.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="Projection.html"><span class="doc">Projections</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="Process.html"><span class="doc">Processes</span></a>.  Mechanisms are composed into processes, by linking them into
pathways with projections.  A projection takes the output of its sender mechanism, and transforms it as necessary to
provide it as input to its receiver mechanism.  The primary purpose of a projection is to convey information from one
mechanism to another, converting the information from its sender into a form that is usable by its receiver.
A process is a linear chain of mechanisms connected by projections.
Projections within a pathway can be recurrent, but they cannot branch (that is done with systems, as described below).
Processes can also be configured for learning, in which the projections are trained to produce a specified output for
each of a given set of inputs.</p>
<p><a class="reference internal" href="System.html"><span class="doc">System</span></a>.  A system is composed of a set of processes.  Typically, the processes of a system overlap &#8211; that is,
they share one or more mechanisms.  The network of processes in a system is explicitly represented as a graph, in which
each node is a mechanism, and each edge is a projection.  The system&#8217;s graph is used to execute it, and can be
exported to display and/or analyze it.  Each system can also have a controller, that can be configured to monitor
the output of any of its mechanisms, evaluate this according to any objective function, and used to control any of the
parameters of the mechanisms&#8217; function so as to optimize the objective function.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The functionality described under <strong>Execution</strong> below is still being implemented.  At present, all mechanisms
operate in <code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">trial</span></code> mode, and some operate in <code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">time_step</span></code> mode;  however, the coordination and
has execution of components with mixed time scales has not yet been fully implemented and debugged.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Execution</strong>.  Mechanisms in PsyNeuLink can be run at one of two time scales.  In <code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">trial</span></code> mode, the
transformation computed by a mechanism is &#8220;complete&#8221; (i.e., the result is stationary.  For example, for an
integrator, the full integral is computed in a single step (analytically where possible).  In <code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">time_step</span></code>
mode, PsyNeuLink approximates &#8220;continuous time&#8221; by breaking computations into sequential time steps at a specified
level of precision. For example, for an intergrator, it numerically integrates the path at a specified rate. A system
automatically coordinates the execution of its mechanisms, synchronizing those that are operating on different time
scales (e.g., suspending ones using <code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">trial</span> <span class="pre">mode</span></code> until those using  <code class="xref std std-keyword docutils literal"><span class="pre">time_step</span></code> mode have met
specified criteria.]</p>
<p>Since mechanisms can implement any function, projections insure that they can &#8220;communicate&#8221; with
each other seamlessly, and systems coordinate execution over different time scales, PsyNeuLink can be used to
integrate mechanisms of different types, levels of analysis, and/or time scales of operation, composing heterogeneous
elements into a single integrated system.  This affords modelers the flexibility to commit each component of their
model to a form of processing and/or level of analysis that is appropriate for that component, while providing
the opportunity to test and explore how they interact with one another in a single system.</p>

<p>Currently, PsyNeuLink is in an alpha state and is not available through pypi/pip.
Instead, you can clone the github repo (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/PsyNeuLink">https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/PsyNeuLink</a>).
Clone the master branch.
Download the package with the green &#8220;Clone or download&#8221; button on the right side of the page and &#8220;Download ZIP.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are familiar with git, the directory can be cloned as usual through the terminal.
Note: The repo is currently private, so if the link leads to a dead page, reach out to one of the developers to get acccess.</p>
<p>PsyNeuLink is compatible with any version of python 3, but the tutorial (see below) requires a 3.5 installation with
the latest versions of IPython, jupyter, and matplotlib installed.</p>
<p>To install the package, navigate to the cloned directory in a terminal,
switch to your preferred python3 environment, then run the command __&#8221;pip install .&#8221;__
(make sure to include the period and to use the appropriate pip/pip3 command for python 3.5).
All prerequisite packages will be automatically added to your environment.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, a tutorial can be run using the terminal command <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jupyter</span> <span class="pre">notebook</span></code> within the root directory
of the PsyNeuLink package.  Once the jupyter notebook opens, within the list of files click on
&#8220;PsyNeuLink Tutorial.ipynb&#8221;.  This will open the tutorial, that will provide any additional information needed to get
started.</p>
