Cognitive Neuroscience Course
=============================

Introduction
------------

This course explores computational techniques and concepts central to modern cognitive neuroscience. It is based on a lab course given at Princeton University, and is designed for students, researchers, and practitioners who are interested in building and simulating cognitive and neural models.

The course is divided into chapters. Each covers a specific topic such as decision making or reinforcement learning, and includes a mix of theoretical background, practical examples, and exercises.

Prerequisites
-------------

This course can be used as hands on introduction to PsyNeuLink and covers essential concepts and components of the library. It does not assume prior knowledge of PsyNeuLink, but familiarity with Python, Numpy, and basic programming concepts is recommended.

When Things Go Wrong
--------------------

This course is a living document, and we are constantly working to improve the language and its documentation.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, let us know by opening an issue in the GitHub repository of `PsyNeuLink <https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/PsyNeuLink>`_.
