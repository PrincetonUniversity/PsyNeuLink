    "When you are looking out at the world through a rainstorm, your sense data are noisy with a messy distribution of water droplets partially obscuring your view at any given moment, but you are typically still able to recognize the landscape. Similarly, if you are walking through a forest on a sunny windy day the pattern of sunlight dancing on the forest floor makes your raw sense data fluctuate unpredictably, but you can still reliably recognize the path, plants, stones, etc. Sense data are often noisy, and Hopfield Networks ([Hopfield, 1982](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554)) can model how to reliably extract signal from and input of signal mixed with noise using associative nodes and thresholds."

    "Next, we'll implement how a Hopfield network can memorize patterns and recognize them when presented with noisy versions of those patterns. First, we'll set up the connections between units in our network, represented by a 25-by-25 weight matrix initialized with zeros. Each unit is connected to every other unit, and we'll manually set the diagonal of the weight matrix to zero to ensure that each unit isn't connected to itself. Each unit corresponds to a \"pixel\" in the input letter patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To \"train\" the network, we supply each input pattern to the network and update the weights. Mathematically, this involves computing the outer product of each pattern (where patterns are represented using 1s and -1s) and adding it to the existing weights. This process effectively constructs a covariance matrix. The result is that when two units are coactivated in a pattern, the strength of their connection increasesâ€”an example of Hebbian learning (Hebb, 1949), which states that \"neurons that fire together, wire together.\""

This new pattern is a transformation of the input pattern based on the learned associations encoded in the weight matrix. The network continues this process, updating the pattern at each step.
