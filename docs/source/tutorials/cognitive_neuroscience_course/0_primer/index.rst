.. note::

   This primer is an optional deep dive into mathematical foundations. It is **not required** for using PsyNeuLink
   or for understanding cognitive modeling at a conceptual level. However, it may be helpful for those who want
   to better understand the computational underpinnings behind models like neural networks and logistic functions.


Overview
--------

Computational modeling in psychology and cognitive neuroscience relies heavily on mathematical concepts. This primer
reviews foundational topics such as *vectors*, *matrices*, and the *logistic function*. It also introduces the basics
of a simple neural network (*perceptron*) through a XOR task, providing a hands-on understanding of the math behind
the models.
