    "# 5.2 Episodic Generalization Optimization - EGO\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Human cognition is unique in its ability to perform a wide range of tasks and to learn new tasks quickly. Both abilities have long been associated with the acquisition of knowledge that can generalize across tasks and the flexible use of that knowledge to execute goal-directed behavior. In this tutorial, we introduce how this can emerge in a neural network by implementing the Episodic Generalization and Optimization (EGO) framework. The framework consists of an episodic memory module, which rapidly learns relationships between stimuli; a semantic pathway, which more slowly learns how stimuli map to responses; and a recurrent context module, which maintains a representation of task-relevant context information, integrates this over time, and uses it to recall context-relevant memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "![EGO](ego_model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The EGO framework consists of a control mechanism (context module; upper middle) and an episodic memory mechanism (bottom left). Episodic memory records conjunctions of stimuli (blue boxes), contexts (pink boxes), and observed responses (green boxes) at each time point (rows). Bidirectional arrows connect episodic memory to the stimulus, context, and output, indicating that these values can be stored in or used to query episodic memory, or retrieved from it when another field is queried. You can think of this as a more flexible dictionary that stores triplets instead of distinct key-value pairs, and allows any field (or any combinations of fields) to act as a key. The context module integrates previous context (recurrent connection) along with information about the stimulus and the context retrieved from memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we show that the EGO framework can emulate human behavior in a specific learning environment where participants are trained on two sets of sequences involving identical states presented in different orders for different contexts. Empirical findings show that participants perform better when trained in blocks of each context than when trained interleaved:\n",

    "Imagine, you are in a city with two coffee shops, each with a different layout and different ways of ordering. In one coffee shop—called *The Suspicious Barista*—you order first, pay for the coffee, and then sit down to wait until the waiter brings your order. In the other coffee shop—called *Café Gratitude*—you sit down first, wait until the waiter comes and takes your order. You pay after finishing the coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates that many situations share similar stimuli but have different transition structures. Simple integration will help the system learn the transition structure, but it will only provide a weak cue about the difference between them due to the similarity between the situations. In other words the states --ordering, paying, and sitting down-- are very similar between the two situations and are therefore hard to distinguish. This can be overcome by differentiating the context representations associated with each setting (e.g., learning different context representations for coffee shops with paranoid vs. gullible baristas). Recent empirical work suggests that people can learn how to do this very effectively, but that this depends on the temporal structure of the environment: people do better when trained in blocks of each situation than when trained interleaved ([Beukers et al., 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00079-4)).\n",
