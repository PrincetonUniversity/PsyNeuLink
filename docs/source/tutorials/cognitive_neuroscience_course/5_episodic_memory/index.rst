5 Episodic Memory
=================

Overview
--------

Here, we will introduce the concept of *episodic memory* by implementing the Episodic Generalization and Optimization (EGO) model of episodic memory described by `Giallanza et al. (2024) <https://doi.org/10.1162/opmi_a_00143>`. First, we will introduce the `EMComposition` class in `PsyNeuLink` that allows us to model episodic memory. Then, we will use this composition as part of the EGO model to simulate how episodic memory and working memory interact in a sequence learning task.
