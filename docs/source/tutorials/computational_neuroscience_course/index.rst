Computational Neuroscience Course
=================================

Introduction
------------

This guide explores computational concepts and methods central to modern cognitive neuroscience, providing practical applications using PsyNeuLink. It is intended for students, researchers, and practitioners interested in constructing and simulating cognitive and neural models.

The course is organized into chapters, each dedicated to a specific topic such as decision making or reinforcement learning. Each chapter combines theoretical background, practical examples, and interactive exercises.


The guide uses visual tags to clearly organize content:

üéØÔ∏è **Exercises** - Practical exercises to reinforce learning.

üí° **Hints** - Helpful hints for solving exercises.

‚úÖ **Solutions** - Complete solutions to exercises.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with Python programming, NumPy, and basic programming concepts.

If you are new to PsyNeuLink, we recommend first completing the PsyNeuLink Beginner Tutorial to establish foundational knowledge before proceeding.

## When Things Go Wrong

This guide is a continually evolving resource, and we greatly value your feedback to enhance its clarity and effectiveness.

If you encounter issues or have suggestions, please:

* Open an issue on the PsyNeuLink repository on GitHub.
* Report any PsyNeuLink-specific bugs directly in the PsyNeuLink repository.

Your input helps us continually improve this guide and the broader PsyNeuLink ecosystem.
