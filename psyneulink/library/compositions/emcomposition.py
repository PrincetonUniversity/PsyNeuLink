#
# TODO:
# - QUESTION:
#   - SHOULD differential of SoftmaxGainControl Node be included in learning?
#   - SHOULD MEMORY DECAY OCCUR IF STORAGE DOES NOT? CURRENTLY IT DOES NOT (SEE EMStorage Function)

# - FIX: Concatenation:
# -      LLVM for function and derivative
# -      Add Concatenate to pytorchcreator_function
# -      Deal with matrix assignment in LearningProjection LINE 643
# -      Reinstate test for execution of Concatenate with learning in test_emcomposition (currently commented out)
# - FIX: Softmax Gain Control:
#        Test if it current works (they are added to Composition but not in BackProp processing pathway)
#        Does backprop have to run through this if not learnable?
#        If so, need to add PNL Function, with derivative and LLVM and Pytorch implementations
# - FIX: WRITE MORE TESTS FOR EXECUTION, WARNINGS, AND ERROR MESSAGES
#         - learning (with and without learning field weights
#         - 3d tuple with first entry != memory_capacity if specified
#         - list with number of entries > memory_capacity if specified
#         - input is added to the correct row of the matrix for each key and value for
#                for non-contiguous keys (e.g, field_weights = [1,0,1]))
#         - explicitly that storage occurs after retrieval
# - FIX: WARNING NOT OCCURRING FOR Normalize ON ZEROS WITH MULTIPLE ENTRIES (HAPPENS IF *ANY* KEY IS EVER ALL ZEROS)
# - FIX: IMPLEMENT LearningMechanism FOR RETRIEVAL WEIGHTS:
#        - what is learning_update: AFTER doing?  Use for scheduling execution of storage_node?
#        ?? implement derivative for concatenate
# - FIX: implement add_storage_pathway to handle addition of storage_node as learning mechanism
#        - in "_create_storage_learning_components()" assign "learning_update" arg
#          as BEORE OR DURING instead of AFTER (assigned to learning_enabled arg of LearningMechanism)
# - FIX: Add StorageMechanism LearningProjections to Composition? -> CAUSES TEST FAILURES; NEEDS INVESTIGATION

#        - MOVE Condition? (e.g., AllHaveRun) (OR PUT ON MECHANISM?)
# - FIX: IMPLEMENT _integrate_into_composition METHOD THAT CALLS _import_composition ON ANOTHER COMPOSITION
# -      AND TRANSFERS RELEVANT ATTRIBUTES (SUCH AS MEMORY, query_input_nodeS, ETC., POSSIBLY APPENDING NAMES)

# - FIX: GENERATE ANIMATION w/ STORAGE (uses Learning but not in usual way)
# - IMPLEMENT use OF multiple inheritance of EMComposition from AutoDiff and Composition

# - FIX: DOCUMENTATION:
#        - enable_learning vs. learning_field_weights
#        - USE OF EMStore.storage_location (NONE => LOCAL, SPECIFIED => GLOBAL)
#        - define "keys" and "values" explicitly
#        - define "key weights" explicitly as field_weights for all non-zero values
#        - make it clear that full size of memory is initialized (rather than "filling up" w/ use)
#        - write examples for run()

# - ACCESSIBILITY OF DISTANCES (SEE BELOW): MAKE IT A LOGGABLE PARAMETER (I.E., WITH APPROPRIATE SETTER)
#   ADD COMPILED VERSION OF NORMED LINEAR_COMBINATION FUNCTION TO LinearCombination FUNCTION: dot / (norm a * norm b)
# - DECAY WEIGHTS BY:
#   ? 1-SOFTMAX / N (WHERE N = NUMBER OF ITEMS IN MEMORY)
#   or
#      1/N (where N=number of items in memory, and thus gets smaller as N gets
#      larger) on each storage (to some asymptotic minimum value), and store the new memory to the unit with the
#      smallest weights (randomly selected among â€œties" [i.e., within epsilon of each other]), I think we have a
#      mechanism that can adaptively use its limited capacity as sensibly as possible, by re-cycling the units
#      that have the least used memories.
# - MAKE "_store_memory" METHOD USE LEARNING INSTEAD OF ASSIGNMENT

#         - Check that error occurs for adding a controller to an AutodiffComposition
#         - Check that if "epochs" is not in input_dict for Autodiff, then:
#           - set to num_trials as default,
#           - leave it to override num_trials if specified (add this to DOCUMENTATION)
#        - Input construction has to be:
#           - same for Autodiff in Python mode and PyTorch mode
#               (NOTE: used to be that autodiff could get left in Python mode
#                      so only where tests for Autodiff happened did it branch)
#           - AND different from Composition (in Python mode)
#        - support use of pathway argument in Autodff
#        - the following format doesn't work for LLVM (see test_identicalness_of_input_types:

#           xor.add_projections([input_to_hidden_wts, hidden_to_output_wts])

#              different model than outer Composition
#        - _validate_input_shapes_and_expand_for_all_trials: consolidate with get_input_format()
#        - Generalize treatment of FEEDBACK specification:
      #        - FIX: ADD TESTS FOR FEEDBACK TUPLE SPECIFICATION OF Projection, DIRECT SPECIFICATION IN CONSTRUCTOR
#              - FIX: why aren't FEEDBACK_SENDER and FEEDBACK_RECEIVER roles being assigned when feedback is specified?
#        - add property that keeps track of warnings that have been issued, and suppresses repeats if specified
#        - add property of Composition that lists it cycles
#        - Add warning if termination_condition is trigged (and verbosePref is set)
#        - Addition of projections to a ControlMechanism seems too dependent on the order in which the
#              the ControlMechanism is constructed with respect to its afferents (if it comes before one,
#              the projection to it (i.e., for monitoring) does not get added to the Composition
# -      - IMPLEMENTATION OF LEARNING: NEED ERROR IF TRY TO CALL LEARN ON A COMPOSITION THAT HAS NO LEARNING MECHANISMS

#        - Change size argument in constructor to use standard numpy shape format if tupe, and PNL format if list
#        - Write convenience Function for returning current time from context

#        - Add Composition.run_status attribute assigned a context flag, with is_preparing property that checks it
#               (paralleling handling of is_initializing)
#        - Allow set of lists as specification for pathways in Composition
#        - Add support for set notation in add_backpropagation_learning_pathway (to match add_linear_processing_pathway)
#             see ScratchPad: COMPOSITION 2 INPUTS UNNESTED VERSION: MANY-TO-MANY
#        - Make sure that shadow inputs (see InputPort_Shadow_Inputs) uses the same matrix as shadowed input.
#        - composition.add_backpropagation_learning_pathway(): support use of set notation for multiple nodes that
#        project to a single one.
#        - add LearningProjections executed in EXECUTION_PHASE to self.projections

.. _EMComposition_Overview:

Overview
--------

The EMComposition implements a configurable, content-addressable form of episodic, or eternal memory, that emulates
an `EpisodicMemoryMechanism` -- reproducing all of the functionality of its `ContentAddressableMemory` `Function` --
in the form of an `AutodiffComposition` that is capable of learning how to differentially weight different cues used
for retrieval,, and that adds the capability for `memory_decay <EMComposition.memory_decay_rate>`. Its `memory
<EMComposition.memory>` is configured using two arguments of its constructor: **memory_template** argument, that defines
how each entry in `memory <EMComposition.memory>` is structured (the number of fields in each entry and the length
of each field); and **field_weights** argument, that defines which fields are used as cues for retrieval, i.e., "keys",
including whether and how they are differentially weighted in the match process used for retrieval); and which
fields are treated as "values" that are stored retrieved, but not used by the match process. The inputs to an
EMComposition, corresponding to each key ("query") and value field are assigned to each of its `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>`
`Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` (listed in its `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and `value_input_nodes
<EMComposition.value_input_nodes>` attributes, respectively), and the retrieved values are represented as `OUTPUT
<NodeRole.OUTPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` of the EMComposition.  The `memory <EMComposition.memory>` can be
accessed using its `memory <EMComposition.memory>` attribute.

    .. technical_note::
       The memories of an EMComposition are actually stored in the `matrix <EMComposition_Memory>` attribute of a
       set of `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` (see `note below <EMComposition_Memory_Storage>`).  The `memory
       <EMComposition.memory>` attribute compiles and formats these as a single 3d array, the rows of which (axis 0)
       are each entry, the columns of which (axis 1) are the fields of each entry, and the items of which (axis 2)
       are the values of each field (see `EMComposition_Memory` for additional details).

.. _EMComposition_Organization:

**Organization**

.. _EMComposition_Entries_and_Fields:

*Entries and Fields*. Each entry in memory can have an arbitrary number of fields, and each field can have an arbitrary
length.  However, all entries must have the same number of fields, and the corresponding fields must all have the same
length across entries. Each field is treated as a separate "channel" for storage and retrieval, and is associated with
its own corresponding input (key or value) and output (retrieved value) `Node <Composition_Nodes>` some or all of
which can be used to compute the similarity of the input (key) to entries in memory, that is used for retreieval.
Fields can be differentially weighted to determine the influence they have on retrieval, using the `field_weights
<ContentAddressableMemory.memory>` parameter (see `retrieval <EMComposition_Retrieval_Storage>` below). The number and
shape of the fields in each entry is specified in the **memory_template** argument of the EMComposition's constructor
(see `memory_template <EMComposition_Fields>`). Which fields treated as keys (i.e., matched against queries during
retrieval) and which are treated as values (i.e., retrieved but not used for matching retrieval) is specified in the
**field_weights** argument of the EMComposition's constructor (see `field_weights <EMComposition_Field_Weights>`).

.. _EMComposition_Operation:

**Operation**

*Retrieval.*  The values retrieved from `memory <ContentAddressableMemory.memory>` (one for each field) are based
on the relative similarity of the keys to the entries in memory, computed as the distance of each key and the
values in the corresponding field for each entry in memory. By default, normalized dot products (comparable to cosine
similarity) are used to compute the similarity of each query to each key in memory. These distances are then
weighted by the corresponding `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` for each field (if specified) and then
summed, and the sum is softmaxed to produce a softmax distribution over the entries in memory. That is then used to
generate a softmax-weighted average of the retrieved values across all fields, which is returned as the `result
<Composition.result>` of the EMComposition's `execution <Composition_Execution>` (an EMComposition can also be
configured to return the entry with the lowest distance weighted by field, however then it is not compatible
with learning; see `softmax_choice <EMComposition_Softmax_Choice>`).

  COMMENT:
  TBD DISTANCE ATTRIBUTES:
  The distances used for the last retrieval is stored in XXXX and the distances of each of their corresponding fields
  (weighted by `distance_field_weights <ContentAddressableMemory.distance_field_weights>`), are returned in XXX,
  respectively.
  COMMENT

*Storage.*  The `inputs <Composition_Input_External_InputPorts>` to the EMComposition's fields are stored in `memory
<EMComposition.memory>` after each execution, with a probability determined by `storage_prob
<EMComposition.storage_prob>`.  If `memory_decay_rate <EMComposition.memory_decay_rate>` is specified, then the `memory
<EMComposition.memory>` is decayed by that amount after each execution.  If `memory_capacity
<EMComposition.memory_capacity>` has been reached, then each new memory replaces the weakest entry (i.e., the one
with the smallest norm across all of its fields) in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`.

.. _EMComposition_Creation:

Creation
--------

An EMComposition is created by calling its constructor, that takes the following arguments:

  .. _EMComposition_Fields:

*Field Specification*

.. _EMComposition_Memory_Template:

* **memory_template**: This specifies the shape of the entries to be stored in the EMComposition's `memory
  <EMComposition.memory>`, and can be used to initialize `memory <EMComposition.memory>` with pre-specified entries.
  The **memory_template** argument can be specified in one of three ways (see `EMComposition_Examples` for
  representative use cases):

  * **tuple**: interpreted as an np.array shape specification, that must be of length 2 or 3.  If it is a 3-item tuple,
    then the first item specifies the number of entries in memory, the 2nd the number of fields in each entry, and the
    3rd the length of each field.  If it is a 2-item tuple, this specifies the shape of an entry, and the number of
    entries is specified by `memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>`).  All entries are
    filled with zeros or the value specified by `memory_fill <EMComposition_Memory_Fill>`.

    .. warning::
       If **memory_template** is specified with a 3-item tuple and `memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>`
       is also specified with a value that does not match the first item of **memory_template**, and error is
       generated indicating the conflict in the number of entries specified.

    .. hint::
       To specify a single field, a list or array must be used (see below), as a 2-item tuple is interpreted as
       specifying the shape of an entry, and so it can't be used to specify the number of entries each of which
       has a single field.

  * **2d list or array**: interpreted as a template for memory entries. This can be used to specify fields of
    different lengths (i.e., entries that are ragged arrays), with each item in the list (axis 0 of the array) used
    to specify the length of the corresponding field.  The template is then used to initialze all entries in `memory
    <EMComposition.memory>`.  If the template includes any non-zero elements, then the array is replicated for all
    entries in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`; otherwise, they are filled with either zeros or the value specified
    in `memory_fill <EMComposition_Memory_Fill>`.

    .. hint::
       To specify a single entry, with all other entries filled with zeros
       or the value specified in **memory_fill**, use a 3d array as described below.

  * **3d list or array**: used to initialize `memory <EMComposition.memory>` directly with the entries specified in
    the outer dimension (axis 0) of the list or array.  If `memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>` is not
    specified, then it is set to the number of entries in the list or array. If **memory_capacity** *is* specified,
    then the number of entries specified in **memory_template** must be less than or equal to **memory_capacity**.  If
    is less than **memory_capacity**, then the remaining entries in `memory <EMComposition.memory>` are filled with
    zeros or the value specified in **memory_fill** (see below):  if all of the entries specified contain only
    zeros, and **memory_fill** is specified, then the matrix is filled with the value specified in **memory_fill**;
    otherwise, zeros are used to fill all entries.

.. _EMComposition_Memory_Capacity:

*Memory Capacity*

* **memory_capacity**: specifies the number of items that can be stored in the EMComposition's memory; when
  `memory_capacity <EMComposition.memory_capacity>` is reached, each new entry overwrites the weakest entry (i.e., the
  one with the smallest norm across all of its fields) in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`.  If `memory_template
  <EMComposition_Memory_Template>` is specified as a 3-item tuple or 3d list or array (see above), then that is used
  to determine `memory_capacity <EMComposition.memory_capacity>` (if it is specified and conflicts with either of those
  an error is generated).  Otherwise, it can be specified using a numerical value, with a default of 1000.  The
  `memory_capacity <EMComposition.memory_capacity>` cannot be modified once the EMComposition has been constructed.

.. _EMComposition_Memory_Fill:

* **memory_fill**: specifies the value used to fill the `memory <EMComposition.memory>`, based on the shape specified
  in the **memory_template** (see above).  The value can be a scalar, or a tuple to specify an interval over which
  to draw random values to fill `memory <EMComposition.memory>` --- both should be scalars, with the first specifying
  the lower bound and the second the upper bound.  If **memory_fill** is not specified, and no entries are specified
  in **memory_template**, then `memory <EMComposition.memory>` is filled with zeros.

  .. hint::
     If memory is initialized with all zeros and **normalize_memories** set to ``True`` (see `below
     <EMComposition_Retrieval_Storage>`) then a numpy.linalg warning is issued about divide by zero.
     This can be ignored, as it does not affect the results of execution, but it can be averted by specifying
     `memory_fill <EMComposition_Memory_Fill>` to use small random values (e.g., ``memory_fill=(0,.001)``).

.. _EMComposition_Field_Weights:

* **field_weights**: specifies which fields are used as keys, and how they are weighted during retrieval. The
  number of entries specified must match the number of fields specified in **memory_template** (i.e., the size of
  of its first dimension (axis 0)). All non-zero entries must be positive; these designate *keys* -- fields
  that are used to match queries against entries in memory for retrieval (see `Match memories by field
  <EMComposition_Processing>`). Entries of 0 designate *values* -- fields that are ignored during the matching
  process, but the values of which are retrieved and assigned as the `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` of the
  corresponding `retrieved_node <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`. This distinction between keys and value corresponds
  to the format of a standard "dictionary," though in that case only a single key and value are allowed, whereas
  here there can be one or more keys and any number of values; if all fields are keys, this implements a full form of
  content-addressable memory. If **learn_field_weights** is True (and `enable_learning<EMComposition.enable_learning>`
  is either True or a list with True for at least one entry), then the field_weights can be modified during training
  (this functions similarly to the attention head of a Transformer model, although at present the field can only be
  scalar values rather than vecdtors); if **learn_field_weights** is False, then the field_weights are fixed.
  The following options can be used to specify **field_weights**:

    * *None* (the default): all fields except the last are treated as keys, and are weighted equally for retrieval,
      while the last field is treated as a value field;

    * *single entry*: all fields are treated as keys (i.e., used for retrieval) and weighted equally for retrieval.
      if `normalize_field_weights <EMComposition_Normalize_Field_Weights>` is True, the value is ignored and all
      of keys are weighted by 1 / number of keys (i.e., normalized), whereas if `normalize_field_weights
      <EMComposition_Normalize_Field_Weights>` is False, then the value specified is used to weight the retrieval of
      every keys.

    * *multiple non-zero entries*: If all entries are identical, the value is ignored and the corresponding keys
      are weighted equally for retrieval; if the non-zero entries are non-identical, they are used to weight the
      corresponding fields during retrieval (see `Weight fields <EMComposition_Processing>`).  In either case,
      the remaining fields (with zero weights) are treated as value fields.

.. _EMComposition_Normalize_Field_Weights:

* **normalize_field_weights**: specifies whether the `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are normalized
    or their raw values are used.  If True, the `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are normalized so that
    they sum to 1.0, and are used to weight (i.e., multiply) the corresponding fields during retrieval (see `Weight
    fields <EMComposition_Processing>`). If False, the raw values of the `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>`
    are used to weight the retrieved value of each field. This setting is ignored if **field_weights**
    is None or `concatenate_queries <EMComposition_Concatenate_Queries>` is in effect.

.. _EMComposition_Field_Names:

* **field_names**: specifies names that can be assigned to the fields.  The number of names specified must
  match the number of fields specified in the memory_template.  If specified, the names are used to label the
  nodes of the EMComposition.  If not specified, the fields are labeled generically as "Key 0", "Key 1", etc..

.. _EMComposition_Concatenate_Queries:

* **concatenate_queries**:  specifies whether keys are concatenated before a match is made to items in memory.
  This is False by default. It is also ignored if the `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` for all keys are
  not all equal (i.e., all non-zero weights are not equal -- see `field_weights <EMComposition_Field_Weights>`) and/or
  `normalize_memories <EMComposition.normalize_memories>` is set to False. Setting concatenate_queries to True in either
  of those cases issues a warning, and the setting is ignored. If the key `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>`
  (i.e., all non-zero values) are all equal *and* **normalize_memories** is set to True, then setting
  **concatenate_queries** causes a `concatenate_queries_node <EMComposition.concatenate_queries_node>` to be created
  that receives input from all of the `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and passes them as a single
  vector to the `mactch_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`.

      .. note::
         While this is computationally more efficient, it can affect the outcome of the `matching process
         <EMComposition_Processing>`, since computing the distance of a single vector comprised of the concatentated
         inputs is not identical to computing the distance of each field independently and then combining the results.

      .. note::
         All `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`
         are always preserved, even when `concatenate_queries <EMComposition.concatenate_queries>` is True, so that
         separate inputs can be provided for each key, and the value of each key can be retrieved separately.

.. _EMComposition_Memory_Decay_Rate

* **memory_decay_rate**: specifies the rate at which items in the EMComposition's memory decay;  the default rate
  is *AUTO*, which sets it to  1 / `memory_capacity <EMComposition.memory_capacity>`, such that the oldest memories
  are the most likely to be replaced when `memory_capacity <EMComposition.memory_capacity>` is reached.  If
  **memory_decay_rate** is set to 0 None or False, then memories do not decay and, when `memory_capacity
  <EMComposition.memory_capacity>` is reached, the weakest memories are replaced, irrespective of order of entry.

.. _EMComposition_Retrieval_Storage:

*Retrieval and Storage*

* **storage_prob** : specifies the probability that the inputs to the EMComposition will be stored as an item in
  `memory <EMComposition.memory>` on each execution.

* **normalize_memories** : specifies whether queries and keys in memory are normalized before computing their dot
  products.

.. _EMComposition_Softmax_Gain:

* **softmax_gain** : specifies the gain (inverse temperature) used for softmax normalizing the combined distances
  used for retrieval (see `EMComposition_Execution` below).  The following options can be used:

  * numeric value: the value is used as the gain of the `SoftMax` Function for the EMComposition's
    `softmax_node <EMComposition.softmax_node>`.

  * *ADAPTIVE*: the `adapt_gain <SoftMax.adapt_gain>` method of the `SoftMax` Function is used to adaptively set
    the `softmax_gain <EMComposition.softmax_gain>` based on the entropy of the distances, in order to preserve
    the distribution over non- (or near) zero entries irrespective of how many (near) zero entries there are
    (see `Thresholding and Adaptive Gain <SoftMax_AdaptGain>` for additional details).

  * *CONTROL*: a `ControlMechanism` is created, and its `ControlSignal` is used to modulate the `softmax_gain
    <EMComposition.softmax_gain>` parameter of the `SoftMax` function of the EMComposition's `softmax_node
    <EMComposition.softmax_node>`.

  If *None* is specified, the default value for the `SoftMax` function is used.

.. _EMComposition_Softmax_Threshold:

* **softmax_threshold**: if this is specified, and **softmax_gain** is specified with a numeric value,
  then any values below the specified threshold are set to 0 before the distances are softmaxed
  (see *mask_threhold* under `Thresholding and Adaptive Gain <SoftMax_AdaptGain>` for additional details).

.. _EMComposition_Softmax_Choice:

* **softmax_choice** : specifies how the `SoftMax` Function of the EMComposition's `softmax_node
  <EMComposition.softmax_node>` is used, with the combined distances, to generate a retrieved item;
  the following are the options that can be used and the retrieved value they produce:

  * *WEIGHTED_AVG* (default): softmax-weighted average based on combined distances of queries and keys in memory.

  * *ARG_MAX*: entry with the smallest distance (one with lowest index in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`)\
               if there are identical ones).

  * *PROBABISTIC*: probabilistically chosen entry based on softmax-transformed distribution of combined distance.

  .. warning::
     Use of the *ARG_MAX* and *PROBABILISTIC* options is not compatible with learning, as these implement a discrete
     choice and thus are not differentiable. Constructing an EMComposition with **softmax_choice** set to either of
     these options and **enable_learning** set to True (or a list with any True entries) will generate a warning, and
     calling the EMComposition's `learn <Composition.learn>` method will generate an error; it must be changed to
     *WEIGHTED_AVG* to execute learning.

  .. technical_note::
     The *WEIGHTED_AVG* option is passed as *ALL* to the **output** argument of the `SoftMax` Function, *ARG_MAX* is
     passed as *ARG_MAX_INDICATOR*; and *PROBALISTIC* is passed as *PROB_INDICATOR*; the other SoftMax options are
     not currently supported.

.. _EMComposition_Learning:

*Learning*

EMComposition supports two forms of learning -- error backpropagation and the learning of `field_weights
<EMComposition.field_weights>` -- that can be configured by the following arguments of the EMComposition's constructor:

* **enable_learning** : specifies whether learning is enabled for the EMComposition and, if so, which `retrieved_nodes
    <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` are used to compute errors, and propagate these back through the network. If
    **enable_learning** is False, then no learning occurs, including of `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>`).
    If it is True, then all of the `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` participate in learning:  For
    those that do not project to an outer Composition (i.e., one in which the EMComposition is `nested
    <Composition_Nested>`), a `TARGET <NodeRole.TARGET>` node is constructed for each, and used to compute errors that
    are backpropagated through the network to its `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and
    `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`, and on to any nodes that project to it from a composition
    in which the EMComposition is `nested <Composition_Nested>`; retrieved_nodes that *do* project to an outer
    Composition receive their errors from those nodes, which are also backpropagated through the EMComposition.
    If **enable_learning** is a list, then only the `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` specified in the
    list participate in learning, and errors are computed only for those nodes.  The list must contain the same
    number of entries as there are `fields <EMComposition_Fields>` and corresponding `retreived_nodes
    <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`, and each entry must be a boolean that specifies whether the corresponding
    `retrieved_node <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` is used for learning.

* **learn_field_weights** : specifies whether `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are modifiable during
    learning (see `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` and `Learning <EMComposition_Learning>` for additional
    information.  For learning of `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` to occur, **enable_learning** must
    also be True, or it must be a list with at least one True entry.  If **learn_field_weights** is True,
    **use_gating_for_weighting** must be False (see `note <EMComposition_Gating_For_Weighting>`).

* **learning_rate** : specifies the rate at which  `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are learned if
  **learn_field_weights** is True; see `Learning <EMComposition_Learning>` for additional information.

.. _EMComposition_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _EMComposition_Input:

*Input*
~~~~~~~

The inputs corresponding to each key and value field are represented as `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes
<Composition_Nodes>` of the EMComposition, listed in its `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>`
and `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>` attributes, respectively,

.. _EMComposition_Memory:

*Memory*
~~~~~~~~

The `memory <EMComposition.memory>` attribute contains a record of the entries in the EMComposition's memory. This
is in the form of a 3d array, in which rows (axis 0) are entries, columns (axis 1) are fields, and items (axis 2) are
the values of an entry in a given field.  The number of fields is determined by the `memory_template
<EMComposition_Memory_Template>` argument of the EMComposition's constructor, and the number of entries is determined
by the `memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>` argument.

  .. _EMComposition_Memory_Storage:
  .. technical_note::
     The memories are actually stored in the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameters of the`MappingProjections`
     from the `combined_matches_node <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>` to each of the `retrieved_nodes
     <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`. Memories associated with each key are also stored (in inverted form) in the
     `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameters of the `MappingProjection <MappingProjection>` from the
     `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` to each of the corresponding `match_nodes
     <EMComposition.match_nodes>`. This is done so that the match of each query to the keys in memory for the
     corresponding field can be computed simply by passing the input for each query through the Projection (which
     computes the distance of the input with the Projection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter) to the
     corresponding match_node; and, similarly, retrieivals can be computed by passing the softmax distributions for
     each field computed in the `combined_matches_node <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>` through its Projection
     to each `retrieved_node <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` (which are inverted versions of the matrices of the
     `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` from the `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` to each
     of the corresponding `match_nodes <EMComposition.match_nodes>`), to compute the distance of the weighted
     softmax over entries with the corresponding field of each entry that yields the retreieved value for each field.

.. _EMComposition_Output:

*Output*
~~~~~~~~

The outputs corresponding to retrieved value for each field are represented as `OUTPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes
<Composition_Nodes>` of the EMComposition, listed in its `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` attribute.

.. _EMComposition_Execution:

Execution
---------

The arguments of the `run <Composition.run>` , `learn <Composition.learn>` and `Composition.execute`
methods are the same as those of a `Composition`, and they can be passed any of the arguments valid for
an `AutodiffComposition`.  The details of how the EMComposition executes are described below.

.. _EMComposition_Processing:

*Processing*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the EMComposition is executed, the following sequence of operations occur
(also see `figure <EMComposition_Example_Fig>`):

* **Input**.  The inputs to the EMComposition are provided to the `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>`
  and `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`.  The former are used for matching to the corresponding
  `fields <EMComposition_Fields>` of the `memory <EMComposition.memory>`, while the latter are retrieved but not used
  for matching.

* **Concatenation**. By default, the input to every `query_input_node <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` is passed to a
  to its own `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` through a `MappingProjection` that computes its
  distance with the corresponding field of each entry in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`.  In this way, each
  match is normalized so that, absent `field_weighting <EMComposition_Field_Weights>`, all keys contribute equally to
  retrieval irrespective of relative differences in the norms of the queries or the keys in memory. However, if the
  `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are the same for all `keys <EMComposition_Field_Weights>` and
  `normalize_memories <EMComposition.normalize_memories>` is True, then the inputs provided to the `query_input_nodes
  <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` are concatenated into a single vector (in the
  `concatenate_queries_node <EMComposition.concatenate_queries_node>`), which is passed to a single `match_node
  <EMComposition.match_nodes>`.  This may be more computationally efficient than passing each query through its own
  `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`,
  COMMENT:
  FROM CodePilot: (OF HISTORICAL INTEREST?)
  and may also be more effective if the keys are highly correlated (e.g., if they are different representations of
  the same stimulus).
  COMMENT
  however it will not necessarily produce the same results as passing each query through its own `match_node
  <EMComposition.match_nodes>` (see `concatenate keys <`concatenate_queries_node>` for additional information).

.. _EMComposition_Distance_Computation:

* **Match memories by field**. The values of each `query_input_node <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>`
  (or the `concatenate_queries_node <EMComposition.concatenate_queries_node>` if `concatenate_queries
  <EMComposition_Concatenate_Queries>` attribute is True) are passed through a `MappingProjection` that
  computes the distance between the corresponding input (query) and each memory (key) for the corresponding field,
  the result of which is possed to the corresponding `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`. By default, the
  distance is computed as the normalized dot product (i.e., between the normalized query vector and the normalized
  key for the corresponding `field <EMComposition_Fields>`, that is comparable to using cosine similarity). However,
  if `normalize_memories <EMComposition.normalize_memories>` is set to False, just the raw dot product is computed.
  The distance can also be customized by specifying a different `function <MappingProjection.function>` for the
  `MappingProjection` to the `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`. The result is assigned as the `value
  <Mechanism_Base.value>` of the corresponding `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`.

.. _EMComposition_Field_Weighting:

* **Weight distances**. If `field weights <EMComposition_Field_Weights>` are specified, then the distance computed
  by the `MappingProjection` to each `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` is multiplied by the corresponding
  `field_weight <EMComposition.field_weights>` using the `field_weight_node <EMComposition.field_weight_nodes>`.
  By default (if `use_gating_for_weighting <EMComposition.use_gating_for_weighting>` is False), this is done using
  the `weighted_match_nodes <EMComposition.weighted_match_nodes>`, each of which receives a Projection from a
  `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` and the corresponding `field_weight_node <EMComposition.field_weight_nodes>`
  and multiplies them to produce the weighted distance for that field as its output.  However, if
  `use_gating_for_weighting <EMComposition.use_gating_for_weighting>` is True, the `field_weight_nodes` are implemented
  as `GatingMechanisms <GatingMechanism>`, each of which uses its `field weight <EMComposition.field_weights>` as a
  `GatingSignal <GatingSignal>` to output gate (i.e., multiplicatively modulate the output of) the corresponding
  `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`. In this case, the `weighted_match_nodes` are not implemented,
  and the output of the `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` is passed directly to the `combined_matches_node
  <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>`.


  .. _EMComposition_Gating_For_Weighting:
  .. note::
     Setting `use_gating_for_weighting <EMComposition.use_gating_for_weighting>` to True reduces the size and
     complexity of the EMComposition, by eliminating the `weighted_match_nodes <EMComposition.weighted_match_nodes>`.
     However, doing to precludes the ability to learn the `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>`,
     since `GatingSignals <GatingSignal>` are  `ModulatorySignal>` that cannot be learned.  If learning is required,
     then `use_gating_for_weighting` should be set to False.

* **Combine distances**.  If `field weights <EMComposition_Field_Weights>` are used to specify more than one `key field
  <EMComposition_Fields>`, then the (weighted) distances computed for each field (see above) are summed across fields
  by the `combined_matches_node <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>`, before being passed to the `softmax_node
  <EMComposition.softmax_node>`. If only one key field is specified, then the output of the `match_node
  <EMComposition.match_nodes>` is passed directly to the `softmax_node <EMComposition.softmax_node>`.

* **Softmax normalize distances**. The distances, passed either from the `combined_matches_node
  <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>`, or directly from the `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` if there is
  only one key field, are passed to the `softmax_node <EMComposition.softmax_node>`, which applies the `SoftMax`
  Function, which generates the softmax distribution used to retrieve entries from `memory <EMComposition.memory>`.
  If a numerical value is specified for `softmax_gain <EMComposition.softmax_gain>`, that is used as the gain (inverse
  temperature) for the SoftMax Function; if *ADAPTIVE* is specified, then the `SoftMax.adapt_gain` function is used
  to adaptively set the gain based on the summed distance (i.e., the output of the `combined_matches_node
  <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>`;  if *CONTROL* is specified, then the summed distance is monitored by a
  `ControlMechanism` that uses the `adapt_gain <Softmax.adapt_gain>` method of the `SoftMax` Function to modulate its
  `gain <Softmax.gain>` parameter; if None is specified, the default value of the `Softmax` Function is used as the
  `gain <Softmax.gain>` parameter (see `Softmax_Gain <EMComposition_Softmax_Gain>` for additional  details).

* **Retrieve values by field**. The vector of softmax weights for each memory generated by the `softmax_node
  <EMComposition.softmax_node>` is passed through the Projections to the each of the `retrieved_nodes
  <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` to compute the retrieved value for each field.

* **Decay memories**.  If `memory_decay <EMComposition.memory_decay>` is True, then each of the memories is decayed
  by the amount specified in `memory_decay_rate <EMComposition.memory_decay_rate>`.

    .. technical_note::
       This is done by multiplying the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `MappingProjection` from
       the `combined_matches_node <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>` to each of the `retrieved_nodes
       <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`, as well as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the
       `MappingProjection` from each `query_input_node <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` to the corresponding
       `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` by `memory_decay <EMComposition.memory_decay_rate>`,
        by 1 - `memory_decay <EMComposition.memory_decay_rate>`.

.. _EMComposition_Storage:

* **Store memories**. After the values have been retrieved, the inputs to for each field (i.e., values in the
  `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`)
  are added by the `storage_node <EMComposition.storage_node>` as a new entry in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`,
  replacing the weakest one if `memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>` has been reached.

    .. technical_note::
       This is done by adding the input vectors to the the corresponding rows of the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
       of the `MappingProjection` from the `combined_matches_node <EMComposition.combined_matches_node>` to each
       of the `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`, as well as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
       parameter of the `MappingProjection` from each `query_input_node <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` to the
       corresponding `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>` (see note `above <EMComposition_Memory_Storage>` for
       additional details). If `memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>` has been reached, then the weakest
       memory (i.e., the one with the lowest norm across all fields) is replaced by the new memory.

COMMENT:
FROM CodePilot: (OF HISTORICAL INTEREST?)
inputs to its `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and
`value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>` are assigned the values of the corresponding items in the
`input <Composition.input>` argument.  The `combined_softmax_node <EMComposition.field_weight_node>`
computes the dot product of each query with each key in memory, and then applies a softmax function to each row of the
resulting matrix.  The `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` then compute the dot product of the
softmaxed values for each memory with the corresponding value for each memory, and the result is assigned to the
corresponding `output <Composition.output>` item.
COMMENT

.. _EMComposition_Training:

*Training*
~~~~~~~~~~

If `learn <Composition.learn>` is called, `enable_learning <EMComposition.enable_learning>` is True or a list with
any True entries, then errors will be computed for each of the `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`
that is specified for learning (see `Learning <EMComposition_Learning>` for details about specification). These errors
are derived either from any errors backprpated to the EMComposition from an outer Composition in which it is `nested
<Composition_Nested>`, or locally by the difference between the `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>`
and the `target_nodes <EMComposition.target_nodes>` that are created for each of the `retrieved_nodes
<EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` that do not project to an outer Composition.  These errors are then backpropagated
through the EMComposition to the `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and `value_input_nodes
<EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`, and on to any nodes that project to it from a composition in which the
EMComposition is `nested <Composition_Nested>`.

If `learn_field_weights <EMComposition.learn_field_weights>` is also True, then the `field_weights
<EMComposition.field_weights>` are modified to minimize the error passed to the EMComposition retrieved nodes, using the
`learning_rate <EMComposition.learning_rate>` specified in the `learning_rate <EMComposition.learning_rate>` attribute.
If `learn_field_weights <EMComposition.learn_field_weights>` is False (or `run <Composition.run>` is called, then the
If `learn_field_weights <EMComposition.learn_field_weights>` is False), then the `field_weights
<EMComposition.field_weights>` are not modified and the EMComposition is simply executed
without any modification, and error signals are passed to the nodes that project to its `query_input_nodes
<EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`.

  .. note::
     The only parameters modifable by learning in the EMComposition are its `field_weights
     <EMComposition.field_weights>`; all other parameters (including all other Projection `matrices
     <MappingProjection.matrix>`) are fixed, and used only to compute gradients and backpropagate errors.

  .. technical_note::
     Although memory storage is implemented as a form of learning (though modification of MappingProjection
     `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameters; see `memory storage <EMComposition_Memory_Storage>`),
     this occurs irrespective of how EMComposition is run (i.e., whether `learn <Composition.learn>` or `run
     <Composition.run>` is called), and is not affected by the `learn_field_weights <EMComposition.learn_field_weights>`
     or `learning_rate <EMComposition.learning_rate>` attributes, which pertain only to whether the `field_weights
     <EMComposition.field_weights>` are modified during learning.  Furthermore, when run in PyTorch mode, storage
     is executed after the forward() and backward() passes are complete, and is not considered as part of the

.. _EMComposition_Examples:

Examples
--------

The following are examples of how to configure and initialize the EMComposition's `memory <EMComposition.memory>`:

*Visualizing the EMComposition*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The EMComposition can be visualized graphically, like any `Composition`, using its `show_graph
<ShowGraph_show_graph_Method>` method.  For example, the figure below shows an EMComposition that
implements a simple dictionary, with one key field and one value field, each of length 5::

    >>> import psyneulink as pnl
    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=(2,5))
    >>> em.show_graph()
    <BLANKLINE>

.. _EMComposition_Example_fig:

.. figure:: _static/EMComposition_Example_fig.svg
   :alt: Exxample of an EMComposition
   :align: left

       **Example of an EMComposition**

       .. note::
          The order in which the nodes at a given level (e.g., the `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` or `OUTPUT
          <NodeRole.OUTPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>`) are shown in the diagram is arbitrary, and does not necessarily
          reflect the order in which they are created or specied in the script.

.. _EMComposition_Example_Memory_Template:

*Memory Template*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `memory_template <EMComposition_Memory_Template>` argument of a EMComposition's constructor is used to configure
it `memory <EMComposition.memory>`, which can be specified using either a tuple or a list or array.

.. _EMComposition_Example_Tuple_Spec:

**Tuple specification**

The simplest form of specification is a tuple, that uses the `numpy shape
<https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.shape.html>`_ format.  If it has two elements (as in the
example above), the first specifies the number of fields, and the second the length of each field.  In this case,
a default number of entries (1000) is created:

    >>> em.memory_capacity
    1000

The number of entries can be specified explicitly in the EMComposition's constructor, using either the
`memory_capacity <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>` argument, or by using a 3-item tuple to specify the
`memory_template <EMComposition_Memory_Template>` argument, in which case the first element specifies
the  number of entries, while the second and their specify the number of fields and the length of each field,
respectively.  The following are equivalent::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=(2,5), memory_capcity=4)

and

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=(4,2,5))

both of which create a memory with 4 entries, each with 2 fields of length 5. The contents of `memory
<EMComposition_Memory>` can be inspected using the `memory <EMComposition.memory>` attribute::

    >>> em.memory
    [[array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])],
     [array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])],
     [array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])],
     [array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]), array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])]]

The default for `memory_capacity <EMComposition.memory_capacity>` is 1000, which is used if it is not otherwise
specified.

**List or array specification**

Note that in the example above the two fields have the same length (5). This is always the case when a tuple is used,
as it generates a regular array.  A list or numpy array can also be used to specify the **memory_template** argument.
For example, the following is equivalent to the examples above::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], memory_capacity=4)

However, a list or array can be used to specify fields of different length (i.e., as a ragged array).  For example,
the following specifies one field of length 3 and another of length 1::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[0,0,0],[0]], memory_capacity=4)
    >>> em.memory
    [[[array([0., 0., 0.]), array([0.])]],
     [[array([0., 0., 0.]), array([0.])]],
     [[array([0., 0., 0.]), array([0.])]],
     [[array([0., 0., 0.]), array([0.])]]]

.. _EMComposition_Example_Memory_Fill:

**Memory fill**

Note that the examples above generate a warning about the use of zeros to initialize the memory. This is
because the default value for **memory_fill** is ``0``, and the default value for `normalize_memories
<EMComposition.normalize_memories>` is True, which will cause a divide by zero warning when memories are
normalized. While this doesn't crash, it will result in nan's that are likely to cauase problems elsewhere.
This can be avoided by specifying a non-zero  value for **memory_fill**, such as small number::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[0,0,0],[0]], memory_capacity=4, memory_fill=.001)
    >>> em.memory
    [[[array([0.001, 0.001, 0.001]), array([0.001])]],
     [[array([0.001, 0.001, 0.001]), array([0.001])]],
     [[array([0.001, 0.001, 0.001]), array([0.001])]],
     [[array([0.001, 0.001, 0.001]), array([0.001])]]]

Here, a single value was specified for **memory_fill** (which can be a float or int), that is used to fill all values.
Random values can be assigned using a tuple to specify and internval between the first and second elements.  For
example, the following uses random values between 0 and 0.01 to fill all entries::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[0,0,0],[0]], memory_capacity=4, memory_fill=(0,0.01))
    >>> em.memory
    [[[array([0.00298981, 0.00563404, 0.00444073]), array([0.00245373])]],
     [[array([0.00148447, 0.00666486, 0.00228882]), array([0.00237541])]],
     [[array([0.00432786, 0.00035378, 0.00265932]), array([0.00980598])]],
     [[array([0.00151163, 0.00889032, 0.00899815]), array([0.00854529])]]]

.. _EMComposition_Example_Multiple_Entries:

**Multiple entries**

In the examples above, a single entry was specified, and that was used as a template for initializing the remaining
entries in memory. However, a list or array can be used to directly initialize any or all entries. For example, the
following initializes memory with two specific entries::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[[1,2,3],[4]],[[100,101,102],[103]]], memory_capacity=4)
    >>> em.memory
    [[[array([1., 2., 3.]), array([4.])]],
     [[array([100., 101., 102.]), array([103.])]],
     [[array([0., 0., 0.]), array([0.])]],
     [[array([0., 0., 0.]), array([0.])]]]

Note that the two entries must have exactly the same shapes. If they do not, an error is generated.
Also note that the remaining entries are filled with zeros (the default value for **memory_fill**).
Here again, **memory_fill** can be used to specify a different value::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[[7],[24,5]],[[100],[3,106]]], memory_capacity=4, memory_fill=(0,.01))
    >>> em.memory
    [[[array([7.]), array([24.,  5.])]],
     [[array([100.]), array([  3., 106.])]],
     [[array([0.00803646]), array([0.00341276, 0.00286969])]],
     [[array([0.00143196]), array([0.00079033, 0.00710556])]]]

.. _EMComposition_Example_Field_Weights:

*Field Weights*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all of the fields specified are treated as keys except the last, which is treated as a "value" field --
that is, one that is not included in the matching process, but for which a value is retrieved along with the key fields.
For example, in the `figure <EMComposition_Example_fig>` above, the first field specified was used as a key field,
and the last as a value field. However, the **field_weights** argument can be used to modify this, specifying which
fields should be used as keys fields -- including the relative contribution that each makes to the matching process
-- and which should be used as value fields.  Non-zero elements in the **field_weights** argument designate key fields,
and zeros specify value fields. For example, the following specifies that the first two fields should be used as keys
while the last two should be used as values::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[0,0,0],[0],[0,0],[0,0,0,0]], memory_capacity=3, field_weights=[1,1,0,0])
    >>> em.show_graph()
    <BLANKLINE>


.. _EMComposition_Example_Field_Weights_Equal_fig:

.. figure:: _static/EMComposition_field_weights_equal_fig.svg

    **Use of field_weights to specify keys and values.**

Note that the figure now shows `<QUERY> [WEIGHT] <EMComposition.field_weight_nodes>` `nodes <Composition_Node>`,
that are used to implement the relative contribution that each key field makes to the matching process specifed in
`field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` argument.  By default, these are equal (all assigned a value of 1),
but different values can be used to weight the relative contribution of each key field.  The values are normalized so
that they sum 1, and the relative contribution of each is determined by the ratio of its value to the sum of all
non-zero values.  For example, the following specifies that the first two fields should be used as keys,
with the first contributing 75% to the matching process and the second field contributing 25%::

    >>> em = EMComposition(memory_template=[[0,0,0],[0],[0,0]], memory_capacity=3, field_weights=[3,1,0])
    <BLANKLINE>

COMMENT:
.. _EMComposition_Example_Field_Weights_Different_fig:

.. figure:: _static/EMComposition_field_weights_different.svg

    **Use of field_weights to specify relative contribution of fields to matching process.**

Note that in this case, the `concatenate_queries_node <EMComposition.concatenate_queries_node>` has been replaced by
a pair of `weighted_match_node <EMComposition.weighted_match_node>`, one for each key field.  This is because
the keys were assigned different weights;  when they are assigned equal weights, or if no weights are specified,
and `normalize_memories <EMComposition.normalize_memories>` is `True`, then the keys are concatenated and are
concatenated for efficiency of processing.  This can be suppressed by specifying `concatenate_queries` as `False`
(see `concatenate_queries <EMComposition_Concatenate_Queries>` for additional details).

        see `field weights <EMComposition_Field_Weights>` for additional details.

    normalize_field_weights : bool : default True
        specifies whether the **fields_weights** are normalized over the number of keys, or used as absolute

        <EMComposition_Normalize_Field_Weights>` for additional details.

    field_names : list : default None
        specifies the optional names assigned to each field in the memory_template;
        see `field names <EMComposition_Field_Names>` for details.

    concatenate_queries : bool : default False
        specifies whether to concatenate the keys into a single field before matching them to items in
        the corresponding fields in memory; see `concatenate keys <EMComposition_Concatenate_Queries>` for details.

    normalize_memories : bool : default True
        specifies whether keys and memories are normalized before computing their dot product (similarity);
        see `Match memories by field <EMComposition_Processing>` for additional details.

    softmax_gain : float, ADAPTIVE or CONTROL : default 1.0
        specifies the temperature used for softmax normalizing the distance of queries and keys in memory;
        see `Softmax normalize matches over fields <EMComposition_Processing>` for additional details.

    softmax_threshold : float : default .0001
        specifies the threshold used to mask out small values in the softmax calculation;
        see *mask_threshold* under `Thresholding and Adaptive Gain <SoftMax_AdaptGain>` for details).

    softmax_choice : WEIGHTED_AVG, ARG_MAX, PROBABILISTIC : default WEIGHTED_AVG
        specifies how the softmax over distances of queries and keys in memory is used for retrieval;
        see `softmax_choice <EMComposition_Softmax_Choice>` for a description of each option.

    storage_prob : float : default 1.0
        specifies the probability that an item will be stored in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`
        when the EMComposition is executed (see `Retrieval and Storage <EMComposition_Storage>` for
        additional details).

    memory_decay_rate : float : AUTO
        specifies the rate at which items in the EMComposition's memory decay;
        see `memory_decay_rate <EMComposition_Memory_Decay_Rate>` for details.

    enable_learning : bool or list[bool]: default True
        specifies whether a learning pathway is constructed for each `field <EMComposition_Entries_and_Fields>`

    learning_rate : float : default .01
        specifies rate at which `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are learned
        if `learn_field_weights <EMComposition.learn_field_weights>` is True.

    # 7/10/24 FIX: STILL TRUE?  DOES IT PRECLUDE USE OF EMComposition as a nested Composition??
    .. technical_note::
        use_storage_node : bool : default True
            specifies whether to use a `LearningMechanism` to store entries in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`.
            If False, a method on EMComposition is used rather than a LearningMechanism.  This is meant for
            debugging, and precludes use of `import_composition <Composition.import_composition>` to integrate
            the EMComposition into another Composition;  to do so, use_storage_node must be True (default).

    use_gating_for_weighting : bool : default False
        specifies whether to use output gating to weight the `match_nodes <EMComposition.match_node>` instead of
        a standard input (see `Weight distances <EMComposition_Field_Weighting>` for additional details).

    Attributes
    ----------

    memory : ndarray
        3d array of entries in memory, in which each row (axis 0) is an entry, each column (axis 1) is a field, and
        each item (axis 2) is the value for the corresponding field;  see `EMComposition_Memory` for additional details.

        .. note::
           This is a read-only attribute;  memories can be added to the EMComposition's memory either by
           COMMENT:

    .. _EMComposition_Parameters:

    memory_capacity : int
        determines the number of items that can be stored in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`; see `memory_capacity
        <EMComposition_Memory_Capacity>` for additional details.

        see `field_weights <EMComposition_Field_Weights>` additional details.

    normalize_field_weights : bool : default True
        determines whether `fields_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are normalized over the number of keys, or

    enable_learning : bool or list[bool]
        determines whether `learning <Composition_Learning>` is enabled for the EMComposition, allowing any error
        received by the `retrieved_nodes <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` to be propagated to the corresponding
        `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and `value_input_nodes
        <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`, and on to any `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` that project to them.
        If True, learning is enabled for all fields and if False learning is disabled for all fields; If it is a
        list, then each entry specifies whether learning is enabled or disabled for the corresponding field
        see `Learning <EMComposition_Learning>` and `Fields <EMComposition_Fields>` for additional details.

    learn_field_weights : bool
        determines whether `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are learnable during training;
        requires `enable_learning <EMComposition.enable_learning>` to be True or a list with at least one True
        entry for the corresponding field; see `Learning <EMComposition_Learning>` for additional details.

    learning_rate : float
        determines whether the rate at which `field_weights <EMComposition.field_weights>` are learned
        if `learn_field_weights` is True;  see `Learning <EMComposition_Learning>` for additional details.

    .. _EMComposition_Nodes:

    query_input_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` that receive keys used to determine the item
        to be retrieved from `memory <EMComposition.memory>`, and then themselves stored in `memory
        <EMComposition.memory>` (see `Match memories by field <EMComposition_Processing>` for additional details).
        By default these are assigned the name *KEY_n_INPUT* where n is the field number (starting from 0);
        however, if `field_names <EMComposition.field_names>` is specified, then the name of each query_input_node
        is assigned the corresponding field name appended with * [QUERY]*.

    value_input_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` that receive values to be stored in `memory
        <EMComposition.memory>`; these are not used in the matching process used for retrieval.  By default these
        are assigned the name *VALUE_n_INPUT* where n is the field number (starting from 0);  however, if
        `field_names <EMComposition.field_names>` is specified, then the name of each value_input_node is assigned
        the corresponding field name appended with * [VALUE]*.

    concatenate_queries_node : ProcessingMechanism
        `ProcessingMechanism` that concatenates the inputs to `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>`
        into a single vector used for the matching processing if `concatenate keys <EMComposition.concatenate_queries>`
        is True. This is not created if the **concatenate_queries** argument to the EMComposition's constructor is
        False or is overridden (see `concatenate_queries <EMComposition_Concatenate_Queries>`), or there is only one
        query_input_node. This node is named *CONCATENATE_QUERIES*

    match_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` that compute the dot product of each query and the key stored in
        the corresponding field of `memory <EMComposition.memory>` (see `Match memories by field
        <EMComposition_Processing>` for additional details). These are named the same as the corresponding
        `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` appended with the suffix *[MATCH to KEYS]*.

    field_weight_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism or GatingMechanism]
        Nodes used to weight the distances computed by the `match_nodes <EMComposition.match_nodes>` with the
        `field weight <EMComposition.field_weights>` for the corresponding `key field <EMComposition_Fields>`
        (see `Weight distances <EMComposition_Field_Weighting>` for implementation). These are named the same
        as the corresponding `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>`.

    weighted_match_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` that combine the  `field weight <EMComposition.field_weights>`
        for each `key field <EMComposition_Fields>` with the dot product computed by the corresponding the
        `match_node <EMComposition.match_nodes>`. These are only implemented if `use_gating_for_weighting
        <EMComposition.use_gating_for_weighting>` is False (see `Weight distances <EMComposition_Field_Weighting>`
        for details), and are named the same as the corresponding `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>`
        appended with the suffix *[WEIGHTED MATCH]*.

    combined_matches_node : ProcessingMechanism
        `ProcessingMechanism` that receives the weighted distances from the `weighted_match_nodes
        <EMComposition.weighted_match_nodes>` if more than one `key field <EMComposition_Fields>` is specified
        (or directly from `match_nodes <EMComposition.match_nodes>` if `use_gating_for_weighting
        <EMComposition.use_gating_for_weighting>` is True), and combines them into a single vector that is passed
        to the `softmax_node <EMComposition.softmax_node>` for retrieval. This node is named *COMBINE MATCHES*.

    softmax_node : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` that computes the softmax over the summed distances of keys
        and memories (output of the `combined_match_node <EMComposition.combined_match_node>`)
        from the corresponding `match_nodes <EMComposition.match_nodes>` (see `Softmax over summed distances
        <EMComposition_Processing>` for additional details).  This is named *RETRIEVE* (as it yields the
        softmax-weighted average over the keys in `memory <EMComposition.memory>`).

    softmax_gain_control_node : list[ControlMechanism]
        `ControlMechanisms <ControlMechanism>` that adaptively control the `softmax_gain <EMComposition.softmax_gain>`
        of the `softmax_node <EMComposition.softmax_node>`. This is implemented only if `softmax_gain
        <EMComposition.softmax_gain>` is specified as *CONTROL* (see `softmax_gain <EMComposition_Softmax_Gain>` for
        details).

    retrieved_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` that receive the vector retrieved for each field in `memory
        <EMComposition.memory>` (see `Retrieve values by field <EMComposition_Processing>` for additional details).
        These are assigned the same names as the `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and
        `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>` to which they correspond appended with the suffix
        * [RETRIEVED]*, and are in the same order as  `input_nodes_by_fields <EMComposition.input_nodes_by_fields>`
        to which to which they correspond.

    storage_node : EMStorageMechanism
        `EMStorageMechanism` that receives inputs from the `query_input_nodes <EMComposition.query_input_nodes>` and
        `value_input_nodes <EMComposition.value_input_nodes>`, and stores these in the corresponding field of`memory
        <EMComposition.memory>` with probability `storage_prob <EMComposition.storage_prob>` after a retrieval has been
        made (see `Retrieval and Storage <EMComposition_Storage>` for additional details). This node is named *STORE*.

        .. technical_note::
           The `storage_node <EMComposition.storage_node>` is assigned a Condition to execute after the `retrieved_nodes
           <EMComposition.retrieved_nodes>` have executed, to ensure that storage occurs after retrieval, but before
           any subequent processing is done (i.e., in a composition in which the EMComposition may be embededded.

    input_nodes : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        Full list of `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` ordered with query_input_nodes first
        followed by value_input_nodes; used primarily for internal computations

    input_nodes_by_fields : list[ProcessingMechanism]
        Full list of `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` in the same order specified in the
        **field_names** argument of the constructor and in `self.field_names <EMComposition.field_names>`.
