.. _KohonenLearningMechanism_Overview:

Overview
--------

An KohonenLearningMechanism is a subclass of `LearningMechanism <LearningMechanism>`, modified for use with a
`KohonenMechanism`.  It implements a form of unsupervised learning used to train a `MappingProjection` to the
KohonenMechanism, to implement a `self-organized map (SOM) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map>`_.

.. _KohonenLearningMechanism_Creation:

Creating a KohonenLearningMechanism
-----------------------------------

An KohonenLearningMechanism can be created directly by calling its constructor, but most commonly it is
created automatically when a KohonenMechanism is `configured for learning <KohonenMechanism_Learning>`.

.. _KohonenLearningMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

An KohonenLearningMechanism is identical to a `LearningMechanism` in all respects except the following:

  * its *ACTIVATION_INPUT* InputPort receives its `Projection` from the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` of the
    `learned_projection <KohonenMechanism.learned_projection>` for the `KohonenMechanisms with which it is associated
    (identified by the `activity_source <KohonenLearningMechanism.activity_source>` attribute);  and its
    *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* InputPort receives its input from the `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` of the
    `learned_projection <KohonenMechanism.learned_projection>`. It does not have a *LEARNING_SIGNAL* `InputPort`
    (since it implements a form of unsupervised learning).

  * it has a single *LEARNING_SIGNAL* `OutputPort` that sends a `LearningProjection` to the `matrix
    <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the KohonenMechanism's `learned_projection
    <KohonenMechanism.learned_projection>`.

  * it has no `input_source <LearningMechanism.input_source>`, `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>`,
    or `error_source <LearningMechanism.error_source>` attributes;  instead, it has a single `matrix
    <KohonenLearningMechanism.matrix>` attribute that identifies the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of
    the KohonenMechanism's `learned_projection <KohonenMechanism.learned_projection>`.

  * its `function <KohonenLearningMechanism.function>` takes as its `variable <Function_Base.variable>`
    a list containing two 1d arrays (the `value <InputPort.value>` of its *ACTIVATION_INPUT* and *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT*
    InputPorts) and a 2d array (the current weight matrix of its `matrix <KohonenLearningMechanism.matrix>`
    attribute), and it returns a `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`
    (a weight change matrix assigned to the Mechanism's *LEARNING_SIGNAL* OutputPort), but not an `error_signal
    <LearningMechanism.error_signal>`.

  * its `learning_rate <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_rate>` can be specified as a 1d or 2d array (or
    matrix) to scale the contribution made, respectively, by individual elements or connections among them,
    to the weight change matrix;  as with a standard `LearningMechanism`, a scalar can also be specified to scale
    the entire weight change matrix (see `learning_rate <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_rate>` for
    additional details).

.. _KohonenLearningMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

An KohonenLearningMechanism executes in the same manner as standard `LearningMechanism`, with two exceptions:
* 1) its execution can be enabled or disabled by setting the `learning_enabled
  <KohonenMechanism.learning_enabled>` attribute of the `KohonenMechanism` with which it is
  associated (identified in its `activity_source <KohonenLearningMechanism.activity_source>` attribute).
* 2) it is executed during the `execution phase <Composition_Execution>` of the Composition's execution.  Note that this is
  different from the behavior of supervised learning algorithms (such as `Reinforcement` and `BackPropagation`),
  that are executed during the `learning phase <Composition_Execution>` of a Composition's execution

    See `LearningMechanism <LearningMechanism_Class_Reference>` for additional arguments and attributes.


    Arguments
    ---------

    variable : List[1d array, 1d array] or 2d np.array : default None
        it must have a two items that corresponds to the value required by the KohonenLearningMechanism's
        `function <KohonenLearningMechanism.function>`;  it must each be compatible (in number and type)
        with the `value <InputPort.value>` of the Mechanism's `InputPort <LearningMechanism_InputPorts>` (see
        `variable <KohonenLearningMechanism.variable>` for additional details).

    learning_signals : List[parameter of Projection, ParameterPort, Projection, tuple[str, Projection] or dict] \
    : default None
        specifies the `matrix <AutoAssociativeProjection.matrix>` to be learned (see `learning_signals
        <LearningMechanism.learning_signals>` for details of specification).

    modulation : str : default ADDITIVE
        specifies the default form of modulation used by the KohonenLearningMechanism's LearningSignals,
        unless they are `individually specified <LearningSignal_Specification>`.

    function : LearningFunction or function : default Kohonen
        specifies the function used to calculate the KohonenLearningMechanism's `learning_signal
        <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_signal>` attribute.  It must take as its **variable** argument a
        list of three items (two 1d arrays and one 2d array, all of
        numeric values) and return a list, 2d np.array that is a square
        matrix with the same dimensions as the third item of the
        **variable** arugment).

    learning_rate : float : default None
        specifies the learning rate for the KohonenLearningMechanism. (see `learning_rate
        <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_rate>` for details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    COMMENT:
        componentType : LEARNING_MECHANISM
    COMMENT

    variable : List[1d array, 1d array]
        has two items, corresponding to the `value <InputPort.value>` of its *ACTIVATION_INPUT* and
        *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* InputPorts.

    activity_source : KohonenMechanism
        the `KohonenMechanism` with which the KohonenLearningMechanism is associated.

    input_ports : ContentAddressableList[OutputPort]
        has a two items, that contains the KohonenLearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_INPUT*  and *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT*
        `InputPorts`.

    learned_projection : MappingProjection
        the `learning_projection <KohonenMechanism.learning_projection>` of the `KohoneMechanism` with which the
        KohonenLearningMechanism is associated (same as its `primary_learned_projection
        <LearningMechanism.primary_learned_projection>`.

    function : LearningFunction or function : default Kohonen
        the function used to calculate the `learning_signal <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_signal>`
        (assigned to the KohonenLearningMechanism's `LearningSignal(s) <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>`).
        It's `variable <Function_Base.variable>` must be a list of three items (two 1d arrays and one 2d array, all of
        numeric values);  returns a list, 2d np.array that is a square matrix with the same dimensions
        as the third item of its `variable <Kohonen.variable>`).

    learning_rate : float, 1d or 2d np.array of numeric values : default None
        determines the learning rate used by the KohonenLearningMechanism's `function
        <KohonenLearningMechanism.function>` to scale the weight change matrix it returns. If it is a scalar, it is
        used to multiply the weight change matrix;  if it is a 2d array or matrix,
        it is used to Hadamard (elementwise) multiply the weight matrix (allowing the contribution of individual
        *connections* to be scaled);  if it is a 1d np.array, it is used to Hadamard (elementwise) multiply the input
        to the `function <KohonenLearningMechanism.function>` (i.e., the `value <InputPort.value>` of the
        KohonenLearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_INPUT* `InputPort <KohonenLearningMechanism_Structure>`,
        allowing the contribution of individual *units* to be scaled). If specified, the value supersedes the
        learning_rate assigned to any `Composition` to which the KohonenLearningMechanism belongs.
        If it is `None`, then the `learning_rate <Composition.learning_rate>` specified for Composition to which it
        belongs is used. If that is `None`, then the `default_learning_rate <LearningFunction.default_learning_rate>`
        for the `function <KohonenLearningMechanism.function>` is used (see `learning_rate
        <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>` for additional details).

    learning_signal : 2d ndarray or matrix of numeric values
        the value returned by `function <KohonenLearningMechanism.function>`, that specifies
        the changes to the weights of the `matrix <KohonenLearningMechanism.matrix>`.
        It is assigned as the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of the KohonenLearningMechanism's `LearningSignal(s)
        <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>` and, in turn, its `LearningProjection(s) <LearningProjection>`.

    learning_signals : List[LearningSignal]
        list of all of the `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` for the KohonenLearningMechanism, each of which
        sends one or more `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` to the `ParameterPort(s) <ParameterPort>` for
        the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `MappingProjection(s)
        <MappingProjection>` trained by the KohonenLearningMechanism.  Although in most instances a
        KohonenLearningMechanism is used to train a single MappingProjection, like a standard
        `LearningMechanism`, it can be assigned additional LearningSignals and/or LearningProjections to train
        additional ones;  in such cases, the `value <LearningSignal>` for all of the LearningSignals is the
        the same:  the KohonenLearningMechanism's `learning_signal
        <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_signal>` attribute.  Since LearningSignals are `OutputPorts
        <OutputPort>`, they are also listed in the KohonenLearningMechanism's `output_ports
        <KohonenLearningMechanism.output_ports>` attribute.

    learning_projections : List[LearningProjection]
        list of all of the LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` from the KohonenLearningMechanism, listed
        in the order of the `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` to which they belong (that is, in the order they are
        listed in the `learning_signals <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_signals>` attribute).

    output_ports : ContentAddressableList[OutputPort]
        list of the KohonenLearningMechanism's `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`, beginning with its
        `learning_signals <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_signals>`, and followed by any additional
        (user-specified) `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`.

    output_values : 2d np.array
        the first item is the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the LearningMechanism's `learning_signal
        <KohonenLearningMechanism.learning_signal>`.

    modulation : str
        the default form of modulation used by the KohonenLearningMechanism's `LearningSignal(s)
        <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>`, unless they are `individually specified <LearningSignal_Specification>`.
