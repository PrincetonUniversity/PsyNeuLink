            original receivers for each of the subject `nodes
            <_GSCUsingNodes.nodes>` (the Operation source) combine with
            the original receivers of `owner <ConditionBase.owner>` (the
            Operation comparison) to produce the new set of receivers
            for the subject `nodes <_GSCUsingNodes.nodes>` after
            `modify_graph`. Operations are applied individually to each
            subject node, and this argument may also be specified as a
            dictionary mapping nodes to separate operations.
        reconnect_non_subject_receivers: If True, `modify_graph`
            will create an edge from all prior senders of `owner` to
            all receivers of `owner` that are not in `nodes`, if
            there is no longer a path from that sender to that
            receiver.
            Defaults to True.
        remove_new_self_referential_edges: If True, `modify_graph`
            will remove any newly-created edges from a node to
            itself.
            Defaults to True.
        prune_cycles: If True, `modify_graph` will attempt to prune
            any newly-created cycles, preferring to remove edges
            adjacent to `owner` that affect the placement of `owner`
            more than any subject `node <nodes>`.
            Defaults to True.
        ignore_conflicts: If True, when any two operations give
            different results for the new senders and receivers of a
            node in `modify_graph`, an error will not be raised.
            Defaults to False.
