.. _Projection_Overview:

Overview
--------

Projections allow information to be passed between `Mechanisms <Mechanism>`.  A Projection takes its input from
its `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` and transmits that information to its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.  The
`sender <Projection_Base.sender>` and `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` of a Projection are always `Ports <Port>`:
the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` is always the `OutputPort` of a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`; the `receiver
<Projection_Base.receiver>` depends upon the type of Projection.  There are two broad categories of Projections,
each of which has subtypes that differ in the type of information they transmit, how they do this, and the type of
`Port <Port>` to which they project (i.e., of their `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`):

* `PathwayProjection <PathwayProjection>`
    Used in conjunction with `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` to convey information along a processing
    `pathway <Process.pathway>`.  There is currently one on type of PathwayProjection:

  * `MappingProjection`
      takes the `value <OutputPort.value>` of an `OutputPort` of a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>`
      converts it by convolving it with the MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
      parameter, and transmits the result to the `InputPort` of another ProcessingMechanism.  Typically,
      MappingProjections are used to connect Mechanisms in the `pathway` of a `Process`, though they can be use for
      other purposes as well (for example, to convey the output of an `ObjectiveMechanism` to a `ModulatoryMechanism
      <ModulatoryMechanism>`).

* `ModulatoryProjection <ModulatoryProjection>`
    takes the `value <OutputPort.value>` of a `ModulatorySignal <ModulatorySignal>` of a `ModulatoryMechanism
    <ProcessingMechanism>`, uses it to regulate modify the `value <Port_Base.value>` of an `InputPort`,
    `ParameterPort` or `OutputPort` of another Component.  ModulatorySignals are specialized types of `OutputPort`,
    that are used to specify how to modify the `value <Port_Base.value>` of the `Port <Port>` to which a
    ModulatoryProjection projects. There are three types of ModulatoryProjections, corresponding to the three types
    of ModulatoryMechanisms (and corresponding ModulatorySignals; see `figure <ModulatorySignal_Anatomy_Figure>`),
    that project to different types of `Ports <Port>`:

  * `LearningProjection`
      takes the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of a `LearningSignal` of a `LearningMechanism`, and transmits this
      to the `ParameterPort` of a `MappingProjection` that uses it to modify its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
      parameter. LearningProjections are used in the `learning Pathway(s) <Composition_Learning_Pathway>` of a
      `Composition`.
  ..
  * `ControlProjection`
      takes the `value <ControlSignal.value>` of a `ControlSignal` of a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`, and
      transmit this to the `ParameterPort of a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that uses it to modify
      the parameter of the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` (or its `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`) for which it is
      responsible.
      COMMENT:
      ControlProjections are used in the `control Pathway(s) <Composition_Control_Pathway>` of a `Composition`.
      COMMENT
  ..
  * `GatingProjection`
      takes the `value <GatingSignal.value>` of a `GatingSignal` of a `GatingMechanism`, and transmits this to
      the `InputPort` or `OutputPort` of a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>` that uses this to modify the
      Port's `value <Port_Base.value>`.  GatingProjections are a special subclass of ControlProjections.

.. _Projection_Creation:

Creating a Projection
---------------------

A Projection can be created on its own, by calling the constructor for the desired type of Projection.  More
commonly, however, Projections are either specified `in context <Projection_Specification>`, or are `created
automatically <Projection_Automatic_Creation>`, as described below.


.. _Projection_Specification:

*Specifying a Projection*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Projections can be specified in a number of places where they are required or permitted, for example in the
specification of a `pathway <Process.pathway>` for a `Process`, where the value of a parameter is specified
(e.g., to assign a `ControlProjection`) or where a `MappingProjection` is specified  (to assign it a
`LearningProjection <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>`).  Any of the following can be used to specify a
Projection in context:

  * **Constructor** -- used the same way in context as it is ordinarily.
  ..
  * **Projection object** -- must be a reference to a Projection that has already been created.
  ..
  * **Projection subclass** -- creates a default instance of the specified Projection type.  The assignment or creation
    of the Projection's `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` is handled in the same manner as described below for keyword
    specifications.
  ..
  * **Keyword** -- creates a default instance of the specified type, which can be any of the following:

      * *MAPPING_PROJECTION* -- if the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and/or its `receiver
        <MappingProjection.receiver>` cannot be inferred from the context in which this specification occurs, then
        its `initialization is deferred <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until both of those have been
        determined (e.g., it is used in the specification of a `Pathway` for a `Composition`). For MappingProjections,
        a `matrix specification <MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>` can also be used to specify the Projection
        (see **value** below).

      COMMENT:
      * *LEARNING_PROJECTION*  (or *LEARNING*) -- this can only be used in the specification of a `MappingProjection`
        (see `tuple <MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>` format).  If the `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`
        of the MappingProjection projects to a `LearningMechanism` or a `ComparatorMechanism` that projects to one,
        then a `LearningSignal` is added to that LearningMechanism and assigned as the LearningProjection's `sender
        <LearningProjection.sender>`;  otherwise, a LearningMechanism is `automatically created
        <LearningMechanism_Creation>`, along with a LearningSignal that is assigned as the LearningProjection's `sender
        <LearningProjection.sender>`. See `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations` for additional details.
      COMMENT

      COMMENT:
      # FIX 5/8/20 [JDC] ELIMINATE SYSTEM:  IS IT TRUE THAT CONTROL SIGNALS ARE AUTOMATICALLY CREATED BY COMPOSITIONS?
      COMMENT
      * *CONTROL_PROJECTION* (or *CONTROL*) -- this can be used when specifying a parameter using the `tuple format
        <ParameterPort_Tuple_Specification>`, to create a default `ControlProjection` to the `ParameterPort` for that
        parameter.  If the `Component <Component>` to which the parameter belongs is part of a `Composition`, then a
        `ControlSignal` is added to the Composition's `controller <Composition.controller>` and assigned as the
        ControlProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`;  otherwise, the ControlProjection's `initialization
        is deferred <ControlProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until the Mechanism is assigned to a Composition, at
        which time the ControlSignal is added to the Composition's `controller <Composition.controller>` and assigned
        as its the ControlProjection's `sender <ControlProjection.sender>`.  See `ControlMechanism_ControlSignals` for
        additional details.

      * *GATING_PROJECTION* (or *GATE*) -- this can be used when specifying an `InputPort
        <InputPort_Projection_Source_Specification>` or an `OutputPort <OutputPort_Projections>`, to create a
        default `GatingProjection` to the `Port <Port>`. If the GatingProjection's `sender <GatingProjection.sender>`
        cannot be inferred from the context in which this specification occurs, then its `initialization is deferred
        <GatingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>` until it can be determined (e.g., a `GatingMechanism` or
        `GatingSignal` is created to which it is assigned).
  ..
  * **value** -- creates a Projection of a type determined by the context of the specification, and using the
    specified value as the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of the Projection, which must be compatible with the
    `variable <Port_Base.variable>` attribute of its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.  If the Projection is a
    `MappingProjection`, the value is interpreted as a `matrix specification <MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>`
    and assigned as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the Projection;  it must be compatible with the
    `value <Port_Base.value>` attribute of its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and `variable <Port_Base.variable>`
    attribute of its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`.
  ..
  * **Mechanism** -- creates a `MappingProjection` to either the `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>` or
    `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>`, depending on the type of Mechanism and context of the specification.
  ..
  * **Port** -- creates a `Projection` to or from the specified `Port`, depending on the type of Port and the
    context of the specification.

  .. _Projection_Specification_Dictionary:

  * **Projection specification dictionary** -- can contain an entry specifying the type of Projection, and/or entries
    specifying the value of parameters used to instantiate it. These should take the following form:

      * *PROJECTION_TYPE*: *<name of a Projection type>* --
        if this entry is absent, a default Projection will be created that is appropriate for the context
        (for example, a `MappingProjection` for an `InputPort`, a `LearningProjection` for the `matrix
        <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a `MappingProjection`, and a `ControlProjection` for any other
        type of parameter.

      * *PROJECTION_PARAMS*: *Dict[Projection argument, argument value]* --
        the key for each entry of the dictionary must be the name of a Projection parameter, and its value the value
        of the parameter.  It can contain any of the standard parameters for instantiating a Projection (in particular
        its `sender <Projection_Sender>` and `receiver <Projection_Receiver>`, or ones specific to a particular type
        of Projection (see documentation for subclass).  If the `sender <Projection_Sender>` and/or
        `receiver <Projection_Receiver>` are not specified, their assignment and/or creation are handled in the same
        manner as described above for keyword specifications.

      COMMENT:
          WHAT ABOUT SPECIFICATION USING OutputPort/ModulatorySignal OR Mechanism? OR Matrix OR Matrix keyword
      COMMENT

      COMMENT:  ??IMPLEMENTED FOR PROJECTION PARAMS??
        Note that parameter
        values in the specification dictionary will be used to instantiate the Projection.  These can be overridden
        during execution by specifying `runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_Params>` for the Projection,
        either when calling the `execute <Mechanism_Base.execute>` or `run <Mechanism_Base.run>`
        method for a Mechanism directly, or where it is specified in the `pathway` of a Process.
      COMMENT

  .. _Projection_ProjectionTuple:

  * **ProjectionTuple** -- a 4-item tuple used in the context of a `Port specification <Port_Specification>` to
    create a Projection between it and another `Port <Port>`. It must have at least the first three of the following
    items in order, and can include the fourth optional item:

     * **Port specification** -- specifies the `Port <Port_Specification>` to connect with (**not** the one being
       connected; that is determined from context)

     * **weight** -- must be a value specifying the `weight <Projection_Base.weight>` of the Projection;  it can be
       `None`, in which case it is ignored, but there must be a specification present;

     * **exponent** -- must be a value specifying the `exponent <Projection_Base.exponent>` of the Projection;  it
       can be `None`, in which case it is ignored, but there must be a specification present;

     * **Projection specification** -- this is optional but, if included, msut be a `Projection specification
       <Projection_Specification>`;  it can take any of the forms of a Projection specification described above for
       any Projection subclass; it can be used to provide additional specifications for the Projection, such as its
       `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` if it is a `MappingProjection`.

    .. note::
       A ProjectionTuple should not be confused with a `4-item InputPort specification tuple
       <InputPort_Tuple_Specification>`, which also contains weight and exponent items.  In a ProjectionTuple, those
       items specify the weight and/or exponent assigned to the *Projection* (see `Projection_Weight_Exponent`),
       whereas in an `InputPort specification tuple <InputPort_Weights_And_Exponents>` they specify the weight
       and/or exponent of the **InputPort**.

    Any (but not all) of the items can be `None`.  If the Port specification is `None`, then there must be a
    Projection specification (used to infer the Port to be connected with).  If the Projection specification is
    `None` or absent, the Port specification cannot be `None` (as it is then used to infer the type of Projection).
    If weight and/or exponent is `None`, it is ignored.  If both the Port and Projection are specified, they must
    be compatible  (see `examples <Port_Projections_Examples>` in Port).


.. _Projection_Automatic_Creation:

*Automatic creation*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under some circumstances Projections are created automatically. For example, a `Composition` automatically creates
a `MappingProjection` between adjacent `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` specified in the **pathways**
argument of its constructor (if none is specified) or in its `add_linear_processing_pathway
<Composition.add_linear_processing_pathway>` method;  and, similarly, `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` are
automatically created when a `learning pathway <Composition_Learning_Pathway>` is added to a Composition.

.. _Projection_Deferred_Initialization:

*Deferred Initialization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a Projection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its `sender
<Projection_Base.sender>` and `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This allows a
Projection to be created before its `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` and/or `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` have
been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor without specifying its **sender** or
**receiver** arguments. However, for the Projection to be operational, initialization must be completed by calling
its `_deferred_init` method.  Under most conditions this occurs automatically (e.g., when the projection is assigned
to a type of Component that expects to be the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` or `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`
for that type of Projection); these conditions are described in the section on *Deferred Initialization* for each type
of Projection.  Otherwise, the  Projection's `_deferred_init` method must be called explicitly, once the missing
attribute assignments have been made.


.. _Projection_Structure:

Structure
---------

In addition to its `function <Projection_Base.function>`, a Projection has two primary attributes: a `sender
<Projection_Base.sender>` and `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.  The types of `Port(s) <Port>` that can be
assigned to these, and the attributes of those Ports to which Projections of each type are assigned, are
summarized in the following table, and described in greater detail in the subsections below.  In addition to the
Port attributes to which different types of Projections are assigned (shown in the table), all of the Projections
of a Port are listed in its `projections <Port_Base.projections>` attribute.

.. _Projection_Table:

    |                      | (`efferents <Port_Base.efferents>`)   | (`mod_afferents <Port_Base.mod_afferents>`)      |
    +----------------------+---------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

.. _Projection_Sender:

*Sender*
~~~~~~~~

This must be an `OutputPort` or a `ModulatorySignal <ModulatorySignal>` (a subclass of OutputPort specialized for
`ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>`).  The Projection is assigned to the OutputPort or ModulatorySignal's
`efferents <Port_Base.efferents>` list and, for ModulatoryProjections, to the list of ModulatorySignals specific to
the `ModulatoryMechanism <ModulatoryMechanism>` from which it projects.  The OutputPort or ModulatorySignal's `value
<OutputPort.value>` is used as the `variable <Function.variable>` for Projection's `function
<Projection_Base.function>`.

A sender can be specified as:

  * an **OutputPort** or **ModulatorySignal**, as appropriate for the Projection's type, using any of the ways for
    `specifying an OutputPort <OutputPort_Specification>`.
  ..
  * a **Mechanism**;  for a `MappingProjection`, the Mechanism's `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` is
    assigned as the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`; for a `ModulatoryProjection <ModulatoryProjection>`, a
    `ModulatorySignal <ModulatorySignal>` of the appropriate type is created and assigned to the Mechanism.

If the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` is not specified and it can't be determined from the context, or an OutputPort
specification is not associated with a Mechanism that can be determined from , then the initialization of the
Projection is `deferred <Projection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

.. _Projection_Receiver:

*Receiver*
~~~~~~~~~~

The `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` required by a Projection depends on its type, as listed below:

    * MappingProjection: `InputPort`
    * LearningProjection: `ParameterPort` (for the `matrix <MappingProjection>` of a `MappingProjection`)
    * ControlProjection: `ParameterPort`
    * GatingProjection: `InputPort` or OutputPort`

A `MappingProjection` (as a `PathwayProjection <PathwayProjection>`) is assigned to the `path_afferents
<Port_Base.path_afferents>` attribute of its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.  The ModulatoryProjections are
assigned to the `mod_afferents <Port.mod_afferents>` attribute of their `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.

A `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` can be specified as:

  * an existing **Port**;
  ..
  * an existing **Mechanism** or **Projection**; which of these is permissible, and how a port is assigned to it, is
    determined by the type of Projection — see subclasses for details).
  ..
  * a **specification dictionary** (see subclasses for details).

.. _Projection_Weight_Exponent:

*Weight and Exponent*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every Projection has a `weight <Projection_Base.weight>` and `exponent <Projection_Base.exponent>` attribute. These
are applied to its `value <Projection_Base.value>` before combining it with other Projections that project to the same
`Port`.  If both are specified, the `exponent <Projection_Base.exponent>` is applied before the `weight
<Projection_Base.weight>`.  These attributes determine both how the Projection's `value <Projection_Base.value>` is
combined with others to determine the `variable <Port_Base.variable>` of the Port to which they project.

.. note::
   The `weight <Projection_Base.weight>` and `exponent <Projection_Base.exponent>` attributes of a Projection are not
   the same as a Port's `weight <Port_Base.weight>` and `exponent <Port_Base.exponent>` attributes.  Also, they are
   not normalized: their aggregate effects contribute to the magnitude of the `variable <Port.variable>` to which
   they project.


*ParameterPorts and Parameters*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`ParameterPorts <ParameterPort>` provide the value for each parameter of a Projection and its `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>`.  ParameterPorts and their associated parameters are handled in the same way by
Projections as they are for Mechanisms (see `Mechanism_ParameterPorts` for details).  The ParameterPorts for a
Projection are listed in its `parameter_ports <Projection_Base.parameter_ports>` attribute.


.. _Projection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A Projection cannot be executed directly.  It is executed when the `Port <Port>` to which it projects (i.e., its
`receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`) is updated;  that occurs when the Port's owner `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is
executed. When a Projection executes, it gets the value of its `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`, assigns this as the
`variable <Projection_Base.variable>` of its `function <Projection_Base.function>`, calls the `function
<Projection_Base.function>`, and provides the result as to its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.  The `function
<Projection_Base.function>` of a Projection converts the value received from its `sender <Projection_Base.sender>` to
a form suitable as input for its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.

COMMENT:
*** ADD EXAMPLES

GET FROM Scratch Pad

for example, if a ProjectionTuple is used in the context of an
    `InputPort specification
    <InputPort_Specification>` to specify a MappingProjection to it from an `OutputPort` that is specified
    in the first item of the tuple, and a Projection specification is included in the fourth, its sender (and/or the
    sending dimensions of its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter) must be compatible with the specified
    OutputPort (see `examples <XXX>` below)

    ProjectionRegistry
    ------------------
        All Projections are registered in ProjectionRegistry, which maintains a dict for each subclass,
        a count for all instances of that type, and a dictionary of those instances
    COMMENT

    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : OutputPort or Mechanism : default None
        specifies the source of the Projection's input. If a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is specified, its
        `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` is used. If it is not specified, it is assigned in
        the context in which the Projection is used, or its initialization will be `deferred
        <Projection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    function : TransferFunction : default MatrixTransform
        specifies function used to convey (and potentially convert) `value <Port_Base.value>` of `sender
        <Projection_Base.sender>` `Port` to `variable <Port_Base.variable>` of `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`
        Port.

    receiver : InputPort or Mechanism : default None
        specifies the destination of the Projection's output.  If a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is specified, its
        `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>` will be used. If it is not specified, it will be assigned in
        the context in which the Projection is used, or its initialization will be `deferred
        <Projection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    feedback : bool or FEEDBACK : default None
        specifies whether Projection is configured as a feedback edge in the graph of a `Composition` to which
        it is assigned (see `Composition_Cycles_and_Feedback`); specifying True or the keyword *FEEDBACK* forces its
        assignment as a *feedback* Projection, whereas False precludes it from being assigned as a feedback Projection;
        None (the default) allows the Composition to determine whether it is assigned as a feedback Projection.

    exclude_in_autodiff : bool : default False
        specifies whether Projection is included in `AutodiffComposition` gradient calculations.

    Attributes
    ----------

    variable : value
        input to Projection, received from `value <OutputPort.value>` of `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`.

    sender : Port
        Port from which Projection receives its input (see `Projection_Sender` for additional information).

    receiver : Port
        Port to which Projection sends its output  (see `Projection_Receiver` for additional information)

    function :  TransferFunction
        conveys (and potentially converts) `variable <Projection_Base.variable>` to `value <Projection_Base.value>`.

    value : value
        output of Projection, transmitted to variable of function of its `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>`.

    parameter_ports : ContentAddressableList[str, ParameterPort]
        a read-only list of the Projection's `ParameterPorts <Mechanism_ParameterPorts>`, one for each of its
        `modulable parameters <ParameterPort_Modulable_Parameters>`, including those of its `function
        <Projection_Base.function>`.  The value of the parameters of the Projection and its `function
        <Projection_Base.function>` are also accessible as (and can be modified using) attributes of the Projection,
        in the same manner as they can for a `Mechanism <Mechanism_ParameterPorts>`).

    exclude_in_autodiff : bool : default False
        determines whether Projection is included in `AutodiffComposition` gradient calculations.

    weight : number
       multiplies the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of the Projection after applying the `exponent
       <Projection_Base.exponent>`, and before combining with any other Projections that project to the same `Port`
       to determine that Port's `variable <Port_Base.variable>` (see `Projection_Weight_Exponent` for details).

    exponent : number
        exponentiates the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of the Projection, before applying `weight
        <Projection_Base.weight>`, and before combining it with any other Projections that project to the same `Port`
        to determine that Port's `variable <Port_Base.variable>` (see `Projection_Weight_Exponent` for details).

    name : str
        the name of the Projection. If the Projection's `initialization has been deferred
        <Projection_Deferred_Initialization>`, it is assigned a temporary name (indicating its deferred initialization
        status) until initialization is completed, at which time it is assigned its designated name.  If that is the
        name of an existing Projection, it is appended with an indexed suffix, incremented for each Projection with the
        same base name (see `Registry_Naming`). If the name is not  specified in the **name** argument of its
        constructor, a default name is assigned by the subclass (see subclass for details)

    """Parse specification(s) for Ports to/from which the connectee_port_type should be connected

    TERMINOLOGY NOTE:
        "CONNECTION" is used instead of "PROJECTION" because:
            - the method abstracts over type and direction of Projection, so it is ambiguous whether
                the projection involved is to or from connectee_port_type; however, can always say it "connects with"
            - specification is not always (in fact, usually is not) in the form of a Projection; usually it is a
                Mechanism or Port to/from which the connectee_port_type should send/receive the Projection

    Connection attributes declared for each type (subclass) of Port that are used here:
        connectsWith : Port
           - specifies the type (subclass) of Port with which the connectee_port_type should be connected
        connectsWithAttribute : str
           - specifies the name of the attribute of the Mechanism that holds the ports of the connectsWith's type
        projectionSocket : [SENDER or RECEIVER]
           - specifies for this method whether to use a Projection's sender or receiver for the connection
        modulators : ModulatorySignal
           -  class of ModulatorySignal that can send ModulatoryProjection to the connectee_port_type

    This method deals with connection specifications that are made in one of the following places/ways:
        - *PROJECTIONS* entry of a Port specification dict;
        - last item of a Port specification tuple.

    In both cases, the connection specification can be a single (stand-alone) item or a list of them.

    Projection(s) in connection(s) can be specified in any of the ways a Projection can be specified;
        * Mechanism specifications are resolved to a primary InputPort or OutputPort, as appropriate
        * Port specifications are assumed to be for connect_with Port,
            and checked for compatibilty of assignment (using projection_socket)
        * keyword specifications are resolved to corresponding Projection class
        * Class assignments are checked for compatiblity with connectee_port_type and connect_with Port

    Each connection specification can, itself, be one of the following:
        * Port object or class;
        * Mechanism object or class - primary Port is used, if applicable, otherwise an exception is generated;
        * dict - must have the first and can have any of the additional entries below:
            *PORT*:<port_spec> - required; must resolve to an instantiated port;  can use any of the following:
                                       Port - the Port is used;
                                       Mechanism - primary Port will be used if appropriate,
                                                   otherwise generates an exception;
                                       {Mechanism:port_spec or [port_spec<, port_spec...>]} -
                                                   each port_spec must be for an instantiated Port of the Mechanism,
                                                   referenced by its name or in a CONNECTION specification that uses
                                                   its name (or, for completeness, the Port itself);
                                                   _parse_connections() is called recursively for each port_spec
                                                   (first replacing the name with the actual port);
                                                   and returns a list of ProjectionTuples; any weights, exponents,
                                                   or projections assigned in those tuples are left;  otherwise, any
                                                   values in the entries of the outer dict (below) are assigned;
                                                   note:  the dictionary can have multiple Mechanism entries

            *WEIGHT*:<int> - optional; specifies weight given to projection by receiving InputPort
            *EXPONENT:<int> - optional; specifies weight given to projection by receiving InputPort
            *PROJECTION*:<projection_spec> - optional; specifies projection (instantiated or matrix) for connection
