.. _MappingProjection_Overview:

Overview
--------

A MappingProjection transmits the `value <OutputPort.value>` of an `OutputPort` of one `ProcessingMechanism
<ProcessingMechanism>` (its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`) to the `InputPort` of another (its `receiver
<MappingProjection.receiver>`). The default `function <Projection_Base.function>` for a MappingProjection is
`MatrixTransform`, which uses the MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` attribute to transform the
value received from its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and provide the result to its `receiver
<MappingProjection.receiver>`.

.. _MappingProjection_Creation:

Creating a MappingProjection
-----------------------------

A MappingProjection can be created in any of the ways that can be used to create a `Projection <Projection_Creation>`
(see `Projection_Sender` and `Projection_Receiver` for specifying its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and
`receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` attributes, respectively), or simply by `specifying it by its matrix parameter
<MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>` wherever a `Projection can be specified <Projection_Specification>`.

MappingProjections are also generated automatically in the following circumstances, using a value for its `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter appropriate to the circumstance:

  * by a `Composition`, when two adjacent `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` in its `pathway <Process.pathway>` do not already
    have a Projection assigned between them (`AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` is used as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
    specification, which determines the appropriate matrix by context);
  ..
  * by an `ObjectiveMechanism`, from each `OutputPort` listed in its `monitored_output_ports
    <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_ports>` attribute to the corresponding `InputPort` of the ObjectiveMechanism
    (`AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX` is used as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` specification, which determines the
    appropriate matrix by context);
  ..
  * by a `LearningMechanism`, between it and the other components required to implement learning
    (see `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations` for details);
  ..
  * by a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>`, from the *OUTCOME* `OutputPort` of the `ObjectiveMechanism` that `it
    creates <ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism>` to its *OUTCOME* `InputPort`, and from the `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`
    listed in the ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_output_ports <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_ports>` attribute
    to the ObjectiveMechanism's `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>` (as described above; an `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is
    used for all of these).

.. _MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification:

*Specifying the Matrix Parameter*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a MappingProjection is created automatically, its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` attribute is generally
assigned using `AUTO_ASSIGN_MATRIX`, which determines its size by context: an `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used if the
`sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` are of equal length; otherwise a
`FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` (all 1's) is used.

When a MappingProjection is created explicitly, the **matrix** argument of its constructor can be used to specify
its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter.  This is used by the MappingProjection's `function
<Projection_Base.function>` to transform the input from its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` into the `value
<Projection_Base.value>` provided to its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`. It can be specified in any of the
following ways:

  * **List or array**  -- if it is a list, each item must be a list or 1d np.array of numbers;  otherwise,
    it must be a 2d np.array.  In each case, the outer dimension (outer list items, array axis 0,
    or matrix rows) corresponds to the elements of the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`, and the inner dimension
    (inner list items, array axis 1, or matrix columns) corresponds to the weighting of the contribution that a
    given `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` makes to the `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` (the number of which
    must match the length of the receiver's `variable <InputPort.variable>`).

  .. _Matrix_Keywords:

  * **Matrix keyword** -- used to specify a standard type of matrix without having to specify its individual
    values, or to allow the type of matrix to be determined by context;  any of the `matrix keywords
    <Keywords.MatrixKeywords>` can be used.

  ..
  * `RandomMatrix` -- assigns a matrix sized appropriately for the **sender** and **receiver**, with random values
    drawn from a uniform distribution with a specified **center** and **range**.

  .. _MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification:

  * **Tuple** -- used to specify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` along with a specification for learning;
    The tuple must have two items: the first can be any of the specifications described above; the second must be
    a `learning specification <MappingProjection_Learning_Tuple_Specification>`.

.. _MappingProjection_Learning_Specification:

*Specifying Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A MappingProjection is specified for learning in any of the following ways:

    * in the **matrix** argument of the MappingProjection's constructor, using the `tuple format
      <MappingProjection_Tuple_Specification>` described above;
    ..
    * specifying a MappingProjection in the `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` of a `Composition`,
      using the `tuple format <MappingProjection_Learning_Tuple_Specification>` to include a learning specification;

    * specifying the MappingProjection (or its *MATRIX* `ParameterPort`) as the `receiver
      <LearningProjection.receiver>` of a `LearningProjection`;
    ..
    * specifying the MappingProjection (or its *MATRIX* `ParameterPort`) in the **projections** argument of
      the constructor for a `LearningSignal <LearningSignal_Specification>`
    ..
    * specifying the MappingProjection (or its *MATRIX* `ParameterPort`) in the **learning_signals** argument of
      the constructor for a `LearningMechanism <LearningSignal_Specification>`

Learning can be disabled for a MappingProjection by specifying its **learnable** argument as `False` in its
constructor.  This can be useful for disabling specific MappingProjections in the `learning pathway
`learning pathway <Composition_Learning_Pathway>` of a `Composition`.

See `LearningMechanism` for an overview of `learning components <LearningMechanism_Overview>` and a detailed
description of `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations`; `Composition_Learning` for a description of how learning
is implemented within a `Composition`;  `MappingProjection_Learning` below for a description of how learning
modifies a MappingProjection.

.. _MappingProjection_Learning_Tuple_Specification:

Specifying Learning in a Tuple
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A tuple can be used to specify learning for a MappingProjection in the **matrix** `argument of its constructor
<MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>` or in the `pathway of a Process <Process_Projections>`.  In both cases,
the second item of the tuple must be a learning specification, which can be any of the following:

  * an existing `LearningProjection`, `LearningSignal`, or a constructor for one -- the specified Component is used, and
    defaults are automatically created for the other `learning Components <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`;
  ..
  * a reference to the LearningProjection or LearningSignal class, or the keyword *LEARNING* or *LEARNING_PROJECTION* --
    a default set of `learning Components <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>` is automatically created.

Specifying Learning for AutodiffCompositions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, all MappingProjections in an `AutodiffComposition` are treated as trainable PyTorch parameters that
are updated during backwards passes through the network, and then used to update the MappingProjection's
`matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` after each batch of train. However, this can be disabled for an individual
MappingProjection by specifying the **learnable** argument as False in its constructor.

.. _MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization:

*Deferred Initialization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a MappingProjection is created, its full initialization is `deferred <Component_Deferred_Init>` until its
`sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` have been fully specified.  This
allows a MappingProjection to be created before its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and/or `receiver
<MappingProjection.receiver>` have been created (e.g., before them in a script), by calling its constructor without
specifying its **sender** or **receiver** arguments. However, for the MappingProjection to be operational,
initialization must be completed by calling its `deferred_init` method.  This is not necessary if the MappingProjection
is specified in the **pathway** argument of a Composition's `add_linear_processing_pathway` or
`learning methods <Composition_Learning_Methods>`, or anywhere else that its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` and
`receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` can be determined by context.

.. _MappingProjection_Structure:

Structure
---------

In addition to its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`, `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`, and `function
<Projection_Base.function>`, a MappingProjection has the following characteristic attributes:

.. _MappingProjection_Matrix:

* `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter - used by the MappingProjection's `function <Projection_Base.function>`
  to carry out a matrix transformation of its input, that is then provided to its `receiver
  <MappingProjection.receiver>`. It can be specified in a variety of ways, as described `above
  <MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>`.

  .. _MappingProjection_Matrix_Dimensionality

  * **Matrix Dimensionality** -- this must match the dimensionality of the MappingProjection's `sender
    <MappingProjection.sender>` and `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`.  For a standard 2d "weight" matrix (i.e.,
    one that maps a 1d array from its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` to a 1d array of its `receiver
    <MappingProjection.receiver>`), the dimensionality of the sender is the number of rows and of the receiver
    the number of columns.  More generally, the sender dimensionality is the number of outer dimensions (i.e.,
    starting with axis 0 of numpy array) equal to the number of dimensions of its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`'s
    `value <Port_Base.value>`, and the receiver dimensionality is the number of inner dimensions equal to its
    `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`'s `variable <Projection_Base.variable>` (equal to the dimensionality of the
    matrix minus its sender dimensionality).

.. _MappingProjection_Matrix_ParameterPort:

* *MATRIX* `ParameterPort` - this receives any `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` that are assigned to the
  MappingProjection (see `MappingProjection_Learning_Specification` above), and updates the current value of the
  MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter in response to `learning
  <LearningMechanism>`.  The `function <ParameterPort.function>` of a *MATRIX* ParameterPort is an
  `AccumulatorIntegrator`, which accumulates the weight changes received from the LearningProjections
  that project to it (see `MappingProjection_Learning` below).  This can be replaced by any function that defines an
  *ADDITIVE_PARAM* `modulatory parameter <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>`), and that takes as its input an array or
  matrix and returns one of the same size.

.. _Mapping_Weight_Exponent:

*  `weight <Projection_Base.weight>` and `exponent <Projection_Base.exponent>` - applied to the `value
   <Projection_Base.value>` of the MappingProjection before it is combined with other MappingProjections to the same
   `InputPort` to determine its `value <InputPort.value>` (see description under `Projection
   <Projection_Weight_Exponent>` for additional details).

   .. note::
      The `weight <Projection_Base.weight>` and `exponent <Projection_Base.exponent>` attributes of a MappingProjection
      are distinct from those of the `InputPort` to which it projects.  It is also important to recognize that,
      as noted under `Projection <Projection_Weight_Exponent>`, they are not normalized, and thus contribute to the
      magnitude of the InputPort's `variable <InputPort.variable>` and therefore its relationship to that of other
      InputPorts that may belong to the same Mechanism.

.. _MappingProjection_Execution:

Execution
---------

A MappingProjection uses its `function <Projection_Base.function>` and `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter to
transform its `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` into a form suitable for the `variable <InputPort.variable>` of its
`receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`.  A MappingProjection cannot be executed directly. It is executed when the
`InputPort` to which it projects (i.e., its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`) is updated;  that occurs when the
InputPort's owner `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is executed. When executed, the MappingProjection's *MATRIX* `ParameterPort`
updates its `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter based on any `LearningProjection(s)` it receives (listed in
the ParameterPort's `mod_afferents <ParameterPort.mod_afferents>` attribute). This brings into effect any changes that
occurred due to `learning <MappingProjection_Learning>`.  Since this does not occur until the Mechanism that receives
the MappingProjection is executed (in accord with `Lazy Evaluation <Component_Lazy_Updating>`), any changes due to
learning do not take effect, and are not observable (e.g., through inspection of the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
attribute or the `value <ParameterPort.value>` of its ParameterPort) until the next `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` of
execution (see `Lazy Evaluation <Component_Lazy_Updating>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

.. _MappingProjection_Learning:

*Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~

Learning modifies the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of a MappingProjection, under the influence
of one or more `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` that project to its *MATRIX* `ParameterPort`.
This conforms to the general procedures for modulation used by `ModulatoryProjections <ModulatoryProjection>`
A LearningProjection `modulates <LearningSignal_Modulation>` the `function <ParameterPort.function>` of the
*MATRIX* ParameterPort, which is responsible for keeping a record of the value of the MappingProjection's matrix,
and providing it to the MappingProjection's `function <Projection_Base.function>` (usually `MatrixTransform`).  By
default, the function for the *MATRIX* ParameterPort is an `AccumulatorIntegrator`.  A LearningProjection
modulates it by assigning the value of its `additive_param <AccumulatorIntegrator.additive_param>` (`increment
<AccumulatorIntegrator.increment>`), which is added to its `previous_value <AccumulatorIntegrator.previous_value>`
attribute each time it is executed. The result is that each time the MappingProjection is executed, and in turn
executes its *MATRIX* ParameterPort, the `weight changes <LearningProjection_Structure>` conveyed to the
MappingProjection from any LearningProjection(s) are added to the record of the matrix kept by the *MATRIX*
ParameterPort's `AccumulatorIntegrator` function in its `previous_value <AccumulatorIntegrator.previous_value>`
attribute. This is then the value of the matrix used  by the MappingProjection's `MatrixTransform` function when it is
executed.  It is important to note that the accumulated weight changes received by a MappingProjection from its
LearningProjection(s) are stored by the *MATRIX* ParameterPort's function, and not the MappingProjection's `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter itself; the latter stores the original value of the matrix before learning (that
is, its unmodulated value, conforming to the general protocol for `modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` in
PsyNeuLink).  The most recent value of the matrix used by the MappingProjection is stored in the `value
<ParameterPort.value>` of its *MATRIX* ParameterPort. As noted `above <MappingProjection_Execution>`, however, this does
not reflect any changes due to learning on the current `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` of execution; those are assigned to the
ParameterPort's `value <ParameterPort.value>` when it executes, which does not occur until the `Mechanism
<Mechanism>` that receives the MappingProjection is executed in the next `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` of execution
(see `Lazy Evaluation <Component_Lazy_Updating>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

    for additional arguments and attributes.

    Arguments
    ---------

    sender : OutputPort or Mechanism : default None
        specifies the source of the Projection's input. If a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is specified, its
        `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` is used. If it is not specified, it is assigned in
        the context in which the MappingProjection is used, or its initialization will be `deferred
        <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    receiver: InputPort or Mechanism : default None
        specifies the destination of the Projection's output.  If a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is specified, its
        `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>` will be used. If it is not specified, it will be assigned in
        the context in which the Projection is used, or its initialization will be `deferred
        <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`.

    matrix : list, np.ndarray, function, `RandomMatrix` or keyword : default DEFAULT_MATRIX
        specifies the matrix used by `function <Projection_Base.function>` (default: `LinearCombination`) to
        transform the `value <Projection_Base.value>` of the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` into a form suitable
        for the `variable <InputPort.variable>` of its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` `InputPort`
        (see `MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification` for additional details).

    learnable : bool : default True
        specifies whether the MappingProjection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter can be modified by
        `learning <LearningMechanism>` (see `MappingProjection_Learning` for additional details).


    Attributes
    ----------

    sender : OutputPort
        the `OutputPort` of the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` that is the source of the Projection's input.

    receiver: InputPort
        the `InputPort` of the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` that is the destination of the Projection's output.

    matrix : 2d np.array
        the matrix used by `function <Projection_Base.function>` to transform the input from the MappingProjection's
        `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` into the value provided to its `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>`.

    has_learning_projection : bool : None
        identifies the `LearningProjection` assigned to the MappingProjection's `MATRIX` `ParameterPort
        <ParameterPort>`.

    learning_mechanism : LearningMechanism
        source of the `learning signal <LearningSignal>` that determines the changes to the `matrix
        <MappingProjection.matrix>` when `learning <LearningMechanism>` is used.

    name : str
        the name of the MappingProjection. If the specified name is the name of an existing MappingProjection,
        it is appended with an indexed suffix, incremented for each MappingProjection with the same base name (see
        `Registry_Naming`). If the name is not specified in the **name** argument of its constructor, a default name is
        assigned using the following format:
        'MappingProjection from <sender Mechanism>[<OutputPort>] to <receiver Mechanism>[InputPort]'
        (for example, ``'MappingProjection from my_mech_1[OutputPort-0] to my_mech2[InputPort-0]'``).
        If either the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` or `receiver <MappingProjection.receiver>` has not yet been
        assigned (the MappingProjection is in `deferred initialization <MappingProjection_Deferred_Initialization>`),
        then the parenthesized name of class is used in place of the unassigned attribute
        (for example, if the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>` has not yet been specified:
        ``'MappingProjection from (OutputPort-0) to my_mech2[InputPort-0]'``).
