.. _LearningSignal_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningSignal is a type of `ModulatorySignal <ModulatorySignal>` that is specialized for use with a
`LearningMechanism` and one or more `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>`, to modify the `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` to which they project.  A
LearningSignal receives the value of a `learning_signal <LearningMechanism>` calculated by the `LearningMechanism` to
which it belongs, which in general is a matrix of weight changes to be made to the `matrix <MappingProjection>`
parameter of the MappingProjection(s) being learned.  The LearningSignal assigns its `learning_signal
<LearningSignal.learning_signal>` as the value of its LearningProjection(s), which convey it to the
MappingProjections` *MATRIX* `ParameterPort(s) <ParameterPort>`, which in turn modify the matrix parameter(s) of
the MappingProjection(s) being learned.

.. _LearningSignal_Creation:

Creating a LearningSignal
-------------------------

A LearningSignal is created automatically whenever a `MappingProjection` is `specified for learning
<LearningMechanism_Creation>` and the Projection belongs to the same `Composition <Composition>` as the
`LearningMechanism`. LearningSignals can also be specified in the **learning_signals** argument of the constructor
for a `LearningMechanism`. Although a LearningSignal can be created directly using its constructor (or any of the
other ways for `creating an OutputPort <OutputPorts_Creation>`), this is neither necessary nor advisable, as a
LearningSignal has dedicated Components and requirements for configuration that must be met for it to function properly.

.. _LearningSignal_Specification:

*Specifying LearningSignals*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a LearningSignal is specified in the **learning_signals** argument of the constructor for a `LearningMechanism`,
the `ParameterPort(s) <ParameterPort>` of the `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` being learned must be
specified.  This can take any of the following forms:

  * an existing LearningSignal, or a reference to the class (in which case a default LearningSignal is created);
  ..
  * a **ParameterPort**, which must be for the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the
    `MappingProjection` to be learned;
  ..
  * a **Projection**, which must be either a `LearningProjection`, or a `MappingProjection` to which the
    LearningSignal should send a `LearningProjection`.  In both cases, it is assumed that the LearningProjection
    projects to the *MATRIX* `ParameterPort` of a `MappingProjection`.
  ..
  * a **tuple**, with the name of the parameter as its 1st item. and the Projection to which it belongs as the 2nd;
    note that this is a convenience format, which is simpler to use than a specification dictionary (see below),
    but precludes specification of any `parameters <LearningSignal_Structure>` for the LearningSignal.
  ..
  * a **specification dictionary**, that must contain at least the following two entries:

    * *NAME*:str
        the string must be the name of the `MappingProjection` to be learned; the LearningSignal is named by
        appending "_LearningSignal" to the name of the Projection.

    * *PROJECTION*:MappingProjection
        the MappingProjection must be valid `projection specification <Projection_Specification>`
        for the one to be learned.

    The dictionary can also contain entries for any other LearningSignal attributes to be specified;
    COMMENT:
    (e.g., a *LEARNING_RATE* entry);
    COMMENT
    see `below <LearningSignal_Structure>` for a description of LearningSignal
    attributes.

.. _LearningSignal_Structure:

Structure
---------

A LearningSignal is owned by an `LearningMechanism`, and "trains" one or more `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`
by modulating the value of their `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameters.  This is governed by three
attributes of the LearningSignal, as described below.

.. _LearningSignal_Projections:

*Projections*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a LearningSignal is created, it can be assigned one or more `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>`,
using either the **projections** argument of its constructor, or in an entry of a dictionary assigned to the
**params** argument with the key *PROJECTIONS*.  These will be assigned to its `efferents
<LearningSignal.efferents>` attribute.  See `Port Projections <Port_Projections>` for additional details
concerning the specification of Projections when creating a Port.

.. note::
   Although a LearningSignal can be assigned more than one `LearningProjection`, all of those Projections will convey
   the same `learning_signal <LearningMechanism>` (received from the LearningMechanism to which the LearningSignal
   belongs).  Thus, for them to be meaningful, they should project to MappingProjections that are responsible for
   identical or systematically-related `error signals <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` (e.g., as in `convolutional
   networks <html LINK>`_.

.. _LearningSignal_Modulation:

*Modulation*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A LearningSignal has a `modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute that determines how the LearningSignal's
`value <LearningSignal.value>` (i.e., its `learning_signal <LearningSignal.learning_signal>`) is used by the
ParameterPort(s) to which it projects to modify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter(s) of their
MappingProjection(s) (see `ModulatorySignal Modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` for an explanation of how the
`modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute is specified and used to modify the value of a parameter).  The
default value is set to the value of the `modulation <LearningMechanism.modulation>` attribute of the
LearningMechanism to which the LearningSignal belongs;  this is the same for all of the LearningSignals belonging to
that LearningMechanism. The default value of `modulation <LearningMechanism.modulation>` for a LearningMechanism is
`ADDITIVE`, which causes the `learning_signal <LearningSignal.learning_signal>` (i.e., its matrix of weight changes)
to be added to the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the MappingProjection being learned.  The
`modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` can be individually specified for a LearningSignal using a
specification dictionary where the LearningSignal itself is specified, as described
`above <LearningSignal_Specification>`. The `modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` value of a LearningSignal is
used by all of the `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` that project from that LearningSignal.

COMMENT:
TBI
.. _LearningSignal_Learning_Rate:

*Learning Rate and Function*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A LearningSignal has a `learning_rate <LearningSignal.learning_rate>` attribute that can be used to specify the
`learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` parameter for its `LearningProjection(s) <LearningProjection>`
(i.e., those listed in its `efferents <LearningSignal.efferents>` attribute).  If specified, it is applied
multiplicatively to the LearningProjection`s `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` and thus can be
used to modulate the learning_rate in addition to (and on top of) one specified for the `LearningMechanism` or its
`function <LearningMechanism.function>`.  Specification of the `learning_rate <LearningSignal.learning_rate>` for a
LearningSignal supersedes the `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for its LearningProjections,
as well the `learning_rate <Composition.learning_rate>` for any `Composition`s to which the LearningSignal's owner
belongs (see `learning_rate <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>` of LearningMechanism and `Composition_Learning_Rate`
for Composition for additional details).
COMMENT

*LearningSignal Function*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `function <LearningSignal.function>` of a LearningSignal converts the `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` it receives from the LearningMechanism to which it belongs to its `value
<LearningSignal.value>` (i.e., the LearningSignal's `learning_signal <LearningSignal.learning_signal>`). By default
this is an identity function (`Linear` with **slope**\\ =1 and **intercept**\\ =0), that simply uses the
LearningMechanism's `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` as its own.  However, the LearningSignal's
`function <LearningSignal.function>` can be assigned another `TransferFunction`, or any other function that takes a
scalar or ndarray and returns a similar value.

.. note:: The `index <OutputPort.OutputPort.index>` and `assign <OutputPort.OutputPort.assign>`
        attributes of a LearningSignal are automatically assigned and should not be modified.


.. _LearningSignal_Execution:

Execution
---------

A LearningSignal cannot be executed directly.  It is executed whenever the `LearningMechanism` to which it belongs is
executed.  When this occurs, the LearningMechanism provides the LearningSignal with a
`learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`, that is used by its `function <LearningSignal.function>` to
compute its `value <LearningSignal.value>` (i.e., its own `learning_signal <LearningSignal.learning_signal>` for that
`TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>`. That value is used by its `LearningProjection(s) <LearningProjection>` to modify the `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` to which the LearningSignal
projects.

.. note::
   The changes in a MappingProjection's matrix parameter in response to the execution of a LearningSignal are not
   applied until the MappingProjection is next executed; see `Lazy Evaluation <Component_Lazy_Updating>` for an
   explanation of "lazy" updating).
