.. _LearningMechanism_Overview:

Overview
--------

A LearningMechanism is a `ModulatoryMechanism <ModulatoryMechanism>` that modifies the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>`
parameter of one or more `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`.  Its function takes one or more `error_signals
<LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` (usually the output of a `ComparatorMechanism` or one or more other
`LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism>`), as well as information about the `MappingProjection(s) and activity
<LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes>` that generated the error(s), and calculates a `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` that is used to modify the MappingProjection(s) by way of its
`LearningProjection(s) <LearningProjection>`.  Typically, a LearningMechanism is used to "train" a single
MappingProjection (its `primary_learned_projection`), using the output of the Mechanism to which that
MappingProjection projects (its `output_source`) as the source of the error it attempts to reduce.  A
LearningMechanism can be used to train multiple MappingProjections, by assigning it `additional LearningProjections
<LearningMechanism_Multiple_LearningSignals>`; however, these will all use the same `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`, generated by the `primary_learned_projection` and its associated `output_source`.
All of the MappingProjection(s) modified by a LearningMechanism must project from one `ProcessingMechanism
<ProcessingMechanism>` to another in the same `Composition`. The learning components of a Composition can be
displayed using the System's `show_graph <System.show_graph>` method with its **show_learning** argument assigned
`True` or *ALL*.

.. _LearningMechanism_Note

*A Note about the Implementation of Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implementation of learning in PsyNeuLink was designed for exposition rather than efficiency. Unlike its
implementation in most other environments -- where the learning algorithm is tightly integrated with the
elements of processing that it modifies --  PsyNeuLink separates it into three constituent components:  An
`ObjectiveMechanism` used to evaluate the most proximal source of error, a `LearningMechanism` that uses that error
(or one derived from it by another LearningMechanism) to calculate a learning signal;  and `LearningProjection(s)
<LearningProjection>` that use that learning signal to modify the weight `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` of the
`MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` being learned.  This has the advantage of isolating and exposing the
constituent computations, making it clearer to students what these are and how they operate, and also making each
individually accessible for reconfiguration. However, it comes at the cost of efficiency.  For efficient execution of
supervised forms of learning (e.g., reinforcement learning and backpropagation), the `AutodiffComposition` can be used,
which allows the model to be specified using PsyNeuLink, but actually executes learning using `PyTorch
<https://pytorch.org>`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Creation:

Creating a LearningMechanism
----------------------------

A LearningMechanism can be created in any of the ways used to `create Mechanisms <Mechanism_Creation>`.
More commonly, however, LearningMechanisms are created automatically.

.. LearningMechanism_Automatic_Creation:

*Automatic Creation*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A LearningMechanism is created automatically when a Composition's `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` is
called.  In that case, a `LearningSignal`, `LearningProjection`, a `ComparatorMechanism` (in the case of `supervised
learning <>`), and any additional Projections required to implement learning that do not already exist are also
instantiated.  This is described below, under `Learning Configurations <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>`.
A LearningMechanism is also created automatically when either the `tuple specification
<MappingProjection_Learning_Tuple_Specification>` is used to specify learning for a MappingProjection, or a
`LearningProjection` is created without specifying its `sender <LearningProjection.sender>` attribute. However, this
is not advised, and should only used in special circumstances, as properly configuring learning generally requires
the instantiation of several other closely related Components, as described below.

.. _LearningMechanism_Explicit_Creation:

*Explicit Creation*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a LearningMechanism is created explicitly (using its constructor), then its **variable** and **error_sources**
arguments must be specified.  The **variable** must have at leaset three items that are compatible (in number and type)
with the `value <InputPort.value>` of the LearningMechanism's `InputPorts <LearningMechanism_InputPorts>`.  Each
item in **error_sources** must be one of the following: a `ComparatorMechanism`, for `single layer learning
<LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning>` or for the last `MappingProjection` in a `learning Pathway
<Composition_Learning_Pathway>` for `multilayer learning <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`; or a
`LearningMechanism`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Signals:

When a LearningMechanism is created explicitly, it can also be assigned existing LearningSignals and/or specified to
create these, as well as `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` from these to specified MappingProjections.  These
are specified in the **learning_signals** argument of the LearningMechanism's constructor, using any of the forms
allowed for `specifying a LearningSignal <LearningSignal_Specification>`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

A LearningMechanism has three types of `InputPorts <InputPort>`, a learning `function <LearningMechanism.function>`,
and two types of `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`. These are used, respectively, to receive, compute, and transmit the
information needed to modify the MappingProjection(s) for which the LearningMechanism is responsible.  In addition,
it has several attributes that govern and provide access to its operation.  These are described below.

.. _LearningMechanism_InputPorts:

*InputPorts*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These receive the information required by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.  They are
listed in the LearningMechanism's `input_ports <LearningMechanism.input_ports>` attribute.  They have the following
names and roles (shown in the `figure <LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning_Figure>` below):

.. _LearningMechanism_Activation_Input:

* *ACTIVATION_INPUT* - receives the value of the input to the `primary_learned_projection`; that is, the `value
  <Projection_Base.value>` of that MappingProjection's `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`. The value is assigned
  as the first item of the LearningMechanism's `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Activation_Output:

* *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* - receives the value of the LearningMechanism's `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>`;
  that is, the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the `OutputPort` of the *ProcessingMechanism* to which the
  `primary_learned_projection` projects.  By default, the `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>`'s
  `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` is used.  However, a different OutputPort can be designated in
  the constructor for the `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>`, by assigning a `parameter specification
  dictionary <ParameterPort_Specification>` to the **params** argument of its constructor, with an entry that uses
  *MONITOR_FOR_LEARNING* as its key and a list containing the desired OutputPort(s) as its value. The `value
  <InputPort.value>` of the *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* InputPort is assigned as the second item of the LearningMechanism's
  `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal:

* *ERROR_SIGNAL* - this receives the `value <OutputPort.value>` from the *OUTCOME* `OutputPort
  <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>` of a `ComparatorMechanism`, or of the *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputPort of another
  `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`. If the `primary_learned_projection` projects
  to the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of the `Composition` to which it belongs, or is not part of a `multilayer learning
  sequence <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`, then the LearningMechanism has a single *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputPort,
  that receives its input from a ComparatorMechanism. If the `primary_learned_projection` is part of a `multilayer
  learning pathway <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`, then the LearningMechanism will have one or more
  *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputPorts, that receive their input from the next LearningMechanism(s) in the sequence;  that is,
  the one(s) associated with the `efferents <Port.efferents>` (outgoing Projections) of its `output_source`,
  with one *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputPort for each of those Projections.  The `value <InputPort.value>`\\s of the
  *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputPorts are summed by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>` to
  calculate the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` (see `below <LearningMechanism_Function>`);
  note that the value of the *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputPort may not be the same as that of the LearningMechanism's
  `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` attribute or *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort
  <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>` (see `note <LearningMechanism_Error_Signal>` below).  If a LearningMechanism
  has more than one *ERROR_SIGNAL* InputPort, their names are suffixed with a hyphenated index, that is incremented for
  each additional InputPort (e.g., ``error_signal-1``, ``error_signal-2``, etc.).  These are listed in the
  LearningMechanism's `error_signal_input_ports` attribute, and the `value <InputPort.value>` of each is assigned
  as an item of the LearningMechanism's `variable <LearningMechanism.variable>` attribute, beginning with its third
  item (i.e., following the `value <InputPort.value>` of the *ACTIVATION_INPUT* and *ACTIVATION_VALUE* InputPorts).

The Mechanisms from the which the `value <InputPort.values>`\\s above are received are listed in the
LearningMechanism's `input_source <LearningMechanism.input_source>`, `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>`,
and `error_sources <LearningMechanism.error_sources>` attributes, respectively (see
`LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes` for additional details).

.. _LearningMechanism_Function:

*Learning Function*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `function <LearningMechanism.function>` of a LearningMechanism uses the values received by the Mechanism's
InputPorts (described `above <LearningMechanism_InputPorts>`) to calculate the value of its `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` and `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` attributes.

.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Signal:

* `learning_signal` - the set of changes to the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the
  `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` being learned, calculated to reduce the summed value of the
  LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort(s) <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Error_Signal:

* `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` - the contribution made by the `primary_learned_projection` to the
  error_signal(s) received by the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort(s)
  <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`. It is used by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`
  to calculate the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`. Depending upon the context and specific
  `LearningFunction <LearningFunctions>` used, it may also take account of the `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` of its
  `output_source`, as well as the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of any of the `output_source`'s
  outgoing Projections that are also being learned (these are listed in the LearningMechanism's `error_matrices
  <LearningMechanism.error_matrices>` attribute).  The value of the `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>`
  is assigned as the value of the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort
  <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`.

  .. _LearningMechanism_Error_Signal_Note:

  .. note::

     A LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort(s) <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` and its
     *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>` may not have the same value.
     The former are the error signal(s) received from a `ComparatorMechanism` or one or more `LearningMechanisms
     <LearningMechanism>`, while the latter is the contribution made to those errors by the `primary_learned_projection`
     and the `output_source`, as calculated by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`
     (see `error_signal <LearningMechanism_Error_Signal>` above).

The default `function <LearningMechanism.function>` of a LearningMechanism is `BackPropagation` (also known as the
*Generalized Delta Rule*; see
`Rumelhart et al., 1986 <http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v323/n6088/abs/323533a0.html>`_).  However, it can be
assigned any other PsyNeuLink `LearningFunction <LearningFunctions>`, or any other Python function that takes as its
input a list or np.array containing three lists or 1d np.arrays of numeric values, and returns two lists or 1d
np.arrays.  The two values it returns are assigned to the LearningMechanism's `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` and `error_signal <LearningSignal.error_signal>` attributes, respectively,
as well as to its two OutputPorts, as described below.

.. _LearningMechanism_OutputPorts:

*OutputPorts*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, a LearningMechanism has two `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`, the first of which is named *ERROR_SIGNAL* and
is assigned the value of the `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` returned by the LearningMechanism's
`function <LearningMechanism.function>`, and the second of which is a `LearningSignal` and is assigned the value of the
`learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` returned by the `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.
They are each described below:

.. _LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal:

* *ERROR_SIGNAL* - this is the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of a LearningMechanism, and  receives the
  value of the `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` used to calculate the `learning_signal
  <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`.  Its value is assigned as the first item of the LearningMechanism's
  `output_values <LearningMechanism.output_values>` attribute.  If the LearningMechanism is part of a `multilayer
  learning pathway <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`, the *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputPort is assigned a Projection
  to the LearningMechanism for the preceding MappingProjection in the sequence being learned - see `figure
  <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_Figure>` below).  Note that the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the
  *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputPort may not be the same as that of the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPorts
  <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` (see `error_signal <LearningMechanism_Error_Signal>`).

.. _LearningMechanism_LearningSignal:

* `LearningSignal(s) <LearningSignal>` - by default, a LearningMechanism has a single LearningSignal, which is a
  special type of OutputPort that receives the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` generated by the
  LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`, and used to modify the `matrix
  <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `primary_learned_projection`.  The LearningSignal is assigned as the
  second item in the list of the LearningMechanism's OutputPorts (i.e., of its `output_ports
  <LearningMechanism.output_ports>` attribute), and its `value <LearningSignal.value>` is assigned as the second
  item of the LearningMechanism's `output_values <LearningMechanism.output_values>` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Multiple_LearningSignals:

  **Multiple LearningSignals and LearningProjections.** Though not common, it is possible for a LearningMechanism to
  be assigned more than one `LearningSignal`, and/or more than one `LearningProjection` to its LearningSignal(s). This
  allows multiple MappingProjections to be trained by a single LearningMechanism. Note, however, that all of the
  LearningSignals of a LearningMechanism (and therefore its LearningProjections) use the same
  `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`, that is calculated based on the LearningMechanism's
  `primary_learned_projection` and its associated `output_source`.  This can be useful in some settings, such as for
  certain forms of `convolutional neural networks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network>`_.

  If all of the LearningProjections are used to implement the same form of `modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>`,
  (determined by their LearningSignals' `modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute), then they should be
  assigned to a single LearningSignal. Multiple LearningProjections can be assigned to a LearningSignal by specifying
  them in the **projections** argument of its constructor, or the *PROJECTIONS* entry of a dictionary assigned to its
  **params** argument); however, the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter for the MappingProjection to which
  they project must have the same shape for all of them. If different forms of modulation are required to train
  different MappingProjections, then multiple LearningSignals should be assigned to the LearningMechanism, each
  specified for one of the required types of modulation, and then LearningProjections assigned to them for the
  corresponding MappingProjections. Multiple LearningSignals can be specified for a LearningMechanism by including
  them in a list assigned to the **learning_signals** argument of the LearningMechanism's constructor.

  The `learning_rate <LearningSignal.learning_rate>` for each LearningSignal, and the `learning_rate
  <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` for each of its `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>`, can all be assigned
  different values (with the latter taking precedence over the former).  If none of these are specified, the
  `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` of the LearningMechanism is used (see `below
  <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>`).

  All of the LearningSignals of a LearningMechanism are listed in its `learning_signals` attribute.  Because these
  are `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`, they are also listed in the `output_ports <LearningMechanism.output_ports>`
  attribute, after the *ERROR_SIGNAL* OutputPort.  All of the LearningMechanism's LearningProjections (that is, those
  belonging to all of its LearningSignals) are listed in its `learning_projections` attribute.

.. _LearningMechanism_Additional_Attributes:

*Additional Attributes*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to its `InputPorts <LearningMechanism_InputPorts>`, `function <LearningMechanism_Function>` and
`OutputPorts <LearningMechanism_OutputPorts>`, a LearningMechanism has the following attributes that
refer to the Components being learned and/or its operation:

.. _LearningMechanism_Primary_Learned_Projection:

* `primary_learned_projection` - the `MappingProjection` with the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter for
  which the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` is computed.  This is always the first Projection
  listed first in LearningMechanism's `learned_projections` attribute.
..
* `learned_projections` - a list of all of the MappingProjections to which the LearningMechanism sends a
  `LearningProjection`, listed in the order of the `LearningSignal(s) <LearningSignal>` to which they belong,
  as those are listed in the LearningMechanism's `learning_signals <LearningMechanism.learning_signals>` attribute.
..
* `learning_enabled <LearningMechanism.learning_enabled>` - determines whether and when the LearningMechanism's
  `learning_projections <LearningMechanism.learning_priojections>` are executed (see `learning_enabled
  <LearningMechanism.learning_enabled>` for additional details).
..
* `input_source` - the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` that sends the `primary_learned_projection`, and projects to the
  LearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_INPUT* `InputPort <LearningMechanism_Activation_Input>`.
..
* `output_source` - the `Mechanism <Mechanism>` that receives the `primary_learned_projection`, and  provides the
  input to the LearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* `InputPort <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>`.
..
* `error_sources` - a `ComparatorMechanism`, `LearningMechanism`, or list of them that calculate the error signal(s)
  provided to the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL(s)* `InputPort(s) <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`.
..
* `error_matrices` - the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameters of the Projections associated with the
  `error_sources <LearningMechanism.error_sources>`;  that is, of any of the `output_source
  <LearningMechanism.output_source>`'s `efferents <OutputPorts.efferents>` that are also being learned.
..
* `modulation` - the default value used for the `modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute of
  LearningMechanism's `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` (i.e. those for which it is not explicitly specified).
  This determines the way in which the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` is used to modify the
  `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `learned_projections`.  By default its value is
  Modulation.ADD, which causes the weight changes in the `learning_signal` to be added to the current value of the
  `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter (see `LearningMechanism_Execution` for a description of how the
  modifications are executed).

.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate:

* `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` - specifies the :keyword:`learning_rate` parameter used by the
  LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`, which uses it to multiply the weight change matrix
  before returning it as the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`.  This can be specified in the
  **learning_rate** argument of the LearningMechanism's constructor (or the constructor for its `function
  <LearningMechanism.function>`;  doing so supersedes specification of the **learning_rate** for a
  `RecurrentTransferMechanism <RecurrentTransferMechanism_Learning>` used to implement `unsupervised learning
  <Composition_Learning_Unsupervised>`, or a Composition's `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` used to
  implement a `supervised learning pathway <Composition_Learning_Supervised>`.  The default value for a
  LearningMechanism's `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` attribute is `None`, in which case the
  LearningMechanism (and its `function <LearningMechanism.function>`) inherit the learning_rate from the
  `RecurrentTransferMechanism <RecurrentTransferMechanism_Learning>` or the `learning method
  <Composition_Learning_Methods>` of a Composition in which learning was defined.  If that is `None`, then it inherits
  the learning_rate specified in the constructor of the `RecurrentTransferMechanism
  <RecurrentTransferMechanism_Learning>` (for unsupervised learning) or Composition's `learning method
  <Composition_Learning_Methods>` (for supervised learning). If that is also `None`, then it uses the value of the
  `default_learning_rate <LearningFunction.default_learning_rate>` parameter of its `function
  <LearningMechanism.function>`. A :keyword:`learning_rate` parameter can also be specified for individual
  `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` and/or their associated `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>`.
  Those have a direct multiplicative effect on the `learning_signal <LearningProjection.learning_signal>` of the
  LearningSignal and/or it LearningProjections (see `LearningSignal learning_rate <LearningSignal_Learning_Rate>`
  for additional details).

.. _LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations:

COMMENT:
@@@ THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE "USER'S MANUAL" WHEN THAT IS WRITTEN
COMMENT

*Learning Configurations*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When learning is enabled for a `RecurrentTransferMechanism <RecurrentTransferMechanism_Learning>` (for `unsupervised
learning <Composition_Learning_Unsupervised>`) or using the `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` of a
Composition, all of the Components required for learning are created automatically. The types of Components that are
generated depend on the type of learning specified and the configuration of the `Composition <Composition>`, as
described below. All of the learning Components of a Composition can be displayed using its `show_graph` method with
the **show_learning** argument assigned `True` or *ALL*.

.. _LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning:

Single layer learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This configuration occurs when `unsupervised learning <Composition_Learning_Unsupervised>` is used, or `supervised
learning <Composition_Learning_Supervised>` is used for a pathway in a Composition with only two Mechanisms (i.e.,
for the Projection between them).  In this case, a single `ComparatorMechanism` and LearningMechanism are created
(if they do not already exist) as well as the following MappingProjections:

* from an `OutputPort` of the LearningMechanism's `output_source` to the ComparatorMechanism's *SAMPLE* `InputPort
  <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>`.  By default, the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of the
  `output_source` is used; however, this can be modified by specifying its *MONITOR_FOR_LEARNING* parameter
  (see `above <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>`).
..
* from the `TARGET_MECHANISM <Composition_Learning_Components>` in the Composition to the ComparatorMechanism's
  *TARGET* `InputPort <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>`;
..
* from the ComparatorMechanism's *OUTCOME* `OutputPort <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>` to the
  LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort <LearningMechanism_Activation_Input>`.

In addition, a `LearningProjection` is created from the `LearningSignal<LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>` for the
`primary_learned_projection` to the `ParameterPort` for the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` of the
`primary_learned_projection`.  Because this configuration involves only a single layer of learning, *no* Projection
is created or assigned to the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`.

.. _LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning_Figure.svg:

    **Components for Single Layer Learning**

    .. figure:: _static/LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning_fig.svg
       :alt: Schematic of Mechanisms and Projections involved in learning for a single MappingProjection
       :scale: 50 %

       Components generated by a call to a `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` of a Composition
       (e.g., ``add_backpropagaption_learning_pathway(pathway=[X, Y]``), labeled by type of Component (in **bold**,
       camelCase), NodeRole(s) assigned (*italics*), learning component type used as key in dictionary returned by
       the learning method (*UPPER_CASE* italics, outside of object) and, where relevant, the name of the attribute
       of the LearningMechanism with which it is associated (*italicized* lower case, outside of object). The
       ComparatorMechanism and LearningMechanism are shown with their InputPorts, OutputPorts and functions
       diagrammed.

.. _LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning:

Multilayer learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This refers to learning in a pathway that has three or more Mechanisms in a sequence, and therefore two or more
MappingProjections that are being learned.  The learning components for such a configuration are created
automatically when a `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` of a Composition is used that supports
multilayer learning (at present, this is only `add_backpropagation_learning_pathway`).  If the learning components
are `constructed explicitly <LearningMechanism_Explicit_Creation>` for a multilayer learning configuration,
then each LearningMechanism must use a `LearningFunction <LearningFunctions>` that can calculate the influence
that each MappingProjection and its output have on the error that the LearningMechanism receives from the previous
one(s) in the sequence (e.g., `BackPropagation`).  Furthermore, the construction of the other `learning-related
Components <Composition_Learning_Components>` associated with each LearningMechanism depend on the position of its
`primary_learned_projection` and `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>` in the sequence.  If it is the
last one in the sequence, it is treated in the same way the LearningMechanism in a `single layer learning configuration
configuration <LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning>`.  This is the  case if the `output_source` is a standalone
Mechanism or the `TERMINAL` Mechanism of a Composition. In these cases, as for single layer learning, a
`ComparatorMechanism` is created that receives the output of the `output_source` as well as the target for learning
(see `TARGET Mechanisms <LearningMechanism_Targets>` below), and projects to a LearningMechanism that is created for
the `primary_learned_projection`.  For all other MappingProjections being learned in the
sequence, the following additional MappingProjections are created for learning (shown in the `figure
<LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_Figure>` below):

* from the `input_source <LearningMechanism.input_source>` to the LearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_INPUT* `InputPort
  <LearningMechanism_Activation_Input>`.
..
* from the `output_source <LearningMechanism.output_source>` to the LearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* `InputPort
  <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>`.
..
* from the *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>` of each of the LearningMechanism's
  `error_sources <LearningMechanisms.error_sources>` to each of its corresponding *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort(s)
  <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`.

In addition, a `LearningProjection` is created from the `LearningSignal <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>` for the
`primary_learned_projection` of each LearningMechanism in the sequence, to the `ParameterPort` for the `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` of the `primary_learned_projection`.  If the `primary_learned_projection` is the first in
the sequence, then *no* Projection is created or assigned to its LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort
<LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`.

    **Components for Multilayer Learning**

    .. figure:: _static/LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning_fig.svg
       :alt: Schematic of Mechanisms and Projections involved in learning for a sequence of MappingProjections
       :scale: 50%

       Components generated by a call to a `learning method <Composition_Learning_Methods>` of a Composition for a
       sequence with three ProcessingMechanisms (and therefore two MappingProjections to be learned; e.g.,
       ``add_backpropagaption_learning_pathway(pathway=[X, Y, Z]``).  Components are labeled by: type of Component (in
       **bold**, camelCase); NodeRole(s) assigned (*italics*) to it; name of learning component type (used as key in
       dictionary returned by the learning method; *UPPER_CASE* italics, outside of object); and, where relevant,
       the name of the attribute of the LearningMechanism with which it is associated (*italicized* lower case,
       outside of object). The ComparatorMechanism and LearningMechanism are shown with their InputPorts, OutputPorts
       and functions diagrammed.

.. _LearningMechanism_Targets:

`TARGET` and `OBJECTIVE` Mechanisms**.  When `supervised learning <Composition_Learning_Supervised>` is
implemented using one of a Composition's `learning methods <Composition_Learning_Methods>`, it automatically creates a
number of  `learning-related Components <Composition_Learning_Components>`.  This includes a `TARGET_MECHANISM`, that
receives the target stimulus specifed in the **inputs** argument of the Composition's `learn <Composition.learn>`
method; and a `OBJECTIVE_MECHANISM`, that computes the error_signal for the sequence.  The output of the
`OBJECTIVE_MECHANISM` is the `error_source <LearningMechanism.error_sources>` for the last MappingProjection in the
learning pathway.  If a multilayer learning pathway is implemented explicitly, it must include these Components.

.. _LearningMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

LearningMechanisms that implement `unsupervised learning <Composition_Learning_Unsupervised>`
(`AutoassociativeLearningMechanisms <AutoAssociativeLearningMechanism>`) execute when the `RecurrentTransferMechanism`
with which they are associated executes.  LearningMechanisms that are part of a `supervised learning pathway
<Composition_Learning_Supervised>` execute after all of the ProcessingMechanisms in the `Composition` to which they
belong have executed.  When a LearningMechanism is executed, it uses the `value <InputPort.value>`(s) of its
*ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort(s) <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` to calculate changes to the weights of the
`matrix <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of its `primary_learned_projection
<LearningMechanism.primary_learned_projection>` and any of its other `learned_projections
<LearningMechanis.learned_projections>`. Those weight changes are assigned as the LearningMechanism's
`learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` attribute, the `value <LearningSignal.value>` of each of its
`LearningSignals <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>`, and as the `value <LearningProjection.value>` of each of their
LearningProjections.  That value is used, in turn, to modify the `value <ParameterPort.value>` of the *MATRIX*
`ParameterPort` of each of the MappingProjections being learned (listed in the LearningMechanism's
`learned_projections <LearningMechanism.learned_projections>` attribute).

Each ParameterPort uses the value it receives from the `LearningProjection` that projects to it to modify the
parameter of its `function <ParameterPort.function>`, in a manner specified by the `modulation
<LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute of the `LearningSignal` from which it receives the LearningProjection (see
`Modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` for a description of how modulation operates). By default, the
`modulation <LearningSignal.modulation>` attribute of a LearningSignal is `ADDITIVE`, the `function
<ParameterPort.function>` of a *MATRIX* ParameterPort for a MappingProjection is `AccumulatorIntegrator`,
and the parameter it uses for additive modulation is its `increment <AccumulatorIntegrator.increment>` parameter.
These assignments cause the value of the LearningProjection to be added to the previous value of the *MATRIX*
ParameterPort, thus incrementing the weights by an amount specified by the LearningMechanism's `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>`. Note, that the changes to the `matrix
<MappingProjection.MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter itself do not take effect until the next time the
`learned_projection` is executed (see `Lazy Evaluation <Component_Lazy_Updating>` for an explanation of
"lazy" updating).

A LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>` also computes an `error_signal
<LearningMechanism.error_signal>` that is assigned as the `value <OutputPort.value>` of its *ERROR_SIGNAL*
`OutputPort <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`;  in a `multilayer learning configuration
<LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`, that value is provided to the *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort(s)
<LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>` of the LearningMechanism(s) for the preceding MappingProjection(s)
being learned in the sequence.

        Description:
            LearningMechanism is a subtype of the ModulatoryMechanism Type of the Mechanism Category of Component
            It implements a Mechanism that calculates changes to a Projection's parameters.
            Its function takes the output of an ObjectiveMechanism and generates a
            learning_signal (ndarray of parameter changes) to be used by the recipient of a LearningProjection
            that projects from the LearningMechanism to a MappingProjection.

    Attributes
    ----------

    COMMENT:
        componentType : LEARNING_MECHANISM
    COMMENT

    variable : 2d np.array
        has three items that serve as the template for the three inputs required by the LearningMechanism's `function
        <LearningMechanism.function>` (corresponding to its three `InputPorts <LearningMechanism_InputPorts>`:
        the input to the `primary_learned_projection` (from `input_source`), the output of the Mechanism to which
        that projects (i.e., of `output_source`); and the error signal (from `LearningMechanism.error_sources`).

    input_ports : ContentAddressableList[OutputPort]
        list containing the LearningMechanism's three `InputPorts <LearningMechanism_InputPorts>`:
        *ACTIVATION_INPUT*,  *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT*, and *ERROR_SIGNAL*.

    error_signal_input_ports : list[InputPorts]
        list of InputPorts that receive error_signals from the LearningMechanism's `error_sources
        <LearningMechanism.error_sources>`.

    input_source : ProcessingMechanism
        the Mechanism that sends the `primary_learned_projection`, and projects to the
        LearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_INPUT* `InputPort <LearningMechanism_Activation_Input>`.

    output_source : ProcessingMechanism
        the Mechanism that receives the `primary_learned_projection`, and  projects to the
        LearningMechanism's *ACTIVATION_OUTPUT* `InputPort <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>`.

    error_sources : list[ComparatorMechanism or LearningMechanism]
        the Mechanism(s) that calculate the error signal(s) provided to the
        LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL(s)* `InputPort(s) <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`.

    error_matrices : list[ParameterPort]
        the matrices of the Projections associated with the `error_sources <LearningMechanism.error_sources>`,
        (i.e., for the next Projection(s) in the learning_sequence, or to the `ComparatorMechanism`);
        note: these are *not* for the LearningMechanism's `learned_projections <LearningMechanism.learned_projections>`.

    primary_learned_projection : MappingProjection
        the Projection with the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter used to generate the
        LearningMechanism's `error_signal <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` and `learning_signal
        <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` attributes.  It is always the first Projection listed in the
        LearningMechanism's `learned_projections <LearningMechanism.learned_projections>` attribute.

    learned_projections : List[MappingProjection]
        all of the MappingProjections modified by the LearningMechanism;  the first item in the list is always the
        `primary_learned_projection <LearningMechanism.primary_learned_projection>`.

    function : LearningFunction or function : default BackPropagation
        specifies the function used to calculate the `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` (assigned
        to the LearningMechanism's `LearningSignal(s) <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>`), and the `error_signal
        <LearningMechanism.error_signal>` (passed to the LearningMechanism for the preceding `MappingProjection` in a
        `multilayer learning pathway <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`).  It takes the following
        three arguments, each of which must be a list or 1d array: **input**,  **output**, and **error** (see
        `LearningMechanism_Function` for additional details).

    learning_rate : float : None
        determines the learning rate for the LearningMechanism.  It is used to specify the :keyword:`learning_rate`
        parameter for the LearningMechanism's `learning function <LearningMechanism.function>`
        (see description of `learning_rate <LearningMechanism_Learning_Rate>` for additional details).

    error_signal : 1d np.array
        one of two values returned by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`.  For
        `single layer learning <LearningMechanism_Single_Layer_Learning>`, this is the same as the value received in
        the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `InputPort <LearningMechanism_Input_Error_Signal>`;  for `multilayer
        learning <LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning>`, it is a modified version of the value received, that takes
        account of the contribution made by the learned_projection and its input to the error signal received. This
        is assigned as the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the LearningMechanism's *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort
        <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`.

    learning_signal : number, ndarray or matrix
        one of two values returned by the LearningMechanism's `function <LearningMechanism.function>`, that specifies
        the changes to the weights of the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter for the LearningMechanism's
        `learned_projections <LearningMechanism.learned_projections>`;  it is calculated to reduce the error signal
        associated with the `primary_learned_projection <LearningMechanism.primary_learned_projection>` and received
        from the LearningMechanism's `error_sources`.  It is assigned as the value of the LearningMechanism's
        `LearningSignal(s) <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>` and, in turn, its LearningProjection(s).

    learning_signals : ContentAddressableList[LearningSignal]
        list of all of the `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` for the LearningMechanism, each of which sends one or
        more `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` to the `ParameterPort(s) <ParameterPort>` for the `matrix
        <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the `MappingProjection(s) <MappingProjection>` trained by the
        LearningMechanism.  The `value <LearningSignal>` of each LearningSignal is the LearningMechanism's
        `learning_signal <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` attribute. Since LearningSignals are `OutputPorts
        <OutputPort>`, they are also listed in the LearningMechanism's `output_ports
        <LearningMechanism.output_ports>` attribute, after it *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort
        <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`.

    learning_projections : List[LearningProjection]
        list of all of the LearningProjections <LearningProject>` from the LearningMechanism, listed in the order of
        the `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>` to which they belong (that is, in the order they are listed in
        the `learning_signals <LearningMechanism>` attribute).

    learning_enabled : bool or Enum[ONLINE|AFTER]
        determines whether and when the `learning_projections <LearningMechanism.learning_projections>` are executed.
        If set to False, they are never updated;  however, the LearningMechanism is still executed in any `Composition`
        to which it belongs, so that the error signals it calculates can be passed to any other LearningMechanism(s)
        to which it projects (see `LearningMechanism_Multilayer_Learning`).  If set to True or `ONLINE`,
        `learning_projections <LearningMechanism.learning_projections>` are updated when the LearningMechanism
        executes.  If set to `AFTER`, `learning_projections <LearningMechanism.learning_projections>` are updated at the
        end of each `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` of execution of the Composition to which the LearningMechanism belongs.

        .. note::
           the `learning_enabled <LearningMechanism.learning_enabled>` attribute of a LearningMechanism determines the
           default behavior of its `learning_projections <LearningMechanism.learning_projections>`.  However, this
           can be overridden for individual `LearningProjections <LearningProjection>` by assigning their
           `learning_enabled <LearningProjection.learning_enabled>` attributes either at or after construction.

    output_ports : ContentAddressableList[OutputPort]
        list of the LearningMechanism's `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`, including its *ERROR_SIGNAL* `OutputPort
        <LearningMechanism_Output_Error_Signal>`, followed by its `LearningSignal(s)
        <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>`, and then any additional (user-specified) `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`.

        `LearningSignal(s) <LearningMechanism_LearningSignal>`, and then those of any additional (user-specified)
        `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`.
