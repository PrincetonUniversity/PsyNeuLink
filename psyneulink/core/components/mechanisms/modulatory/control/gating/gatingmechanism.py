.. _GatingMechanism_Overview:

Overview
--------

A GatingMechanism is a subclass of `ControlMechanism` that is restricted to using only `GatingSignals <GatingSignal>`,
which modulate the `input <Mechanism_InputPorts>` or `output <Mechanism_OutputPorts>` of a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`,
but not the paramaters of its `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`.  Accordingly, its constructor has a **gate**
argument in place of a **control** argument.  It also lacks several attributes related to control, including those
related to costs and net_outcome.  In all other respects it is identical to its parent class, ControlMechanism.

.. _GatingMechanism_Creation:

Creating A GatingMechanism
---------------------------

A GatingMechanism is created by calling its constructor.  When a GatingMechanism is created, the OutputPorts it
monitors and the `InputPorts <InputPort>` and/or `OutputPorts <OutputPort>` it modulates can be specified in the
**montior_for_gating** and **gate** arguments of its constructor, respectively.  Each can be specified in several
ways, paralleling those used for a ControlMechanism, and described in `ControlMechanism_Monitor_for_Control` and
`ControlMechanism_ControlSignals` respectively. If neither the **montior_for_gating** or **gate** arguments is
specified, then only the GatingMechanism is constructed, and its inputs and the InputPorts and/or OutputPorts it
modulates must be specified in some other way.
COMMENT:
TBI FOR COMPOSITION
A GatingMechanism is also created automatically if `gating
is specified <GatingMechanism_Specifying_Gating>` for an `InputPort`, `OutputPort` or `Mechanism <Mechanism>`,
in which case a `GatingProjection` is automatically created that projects from the GatingMechanism to the specified
target.
COMMENT

.. _GatingMechanism_Specifying_Gating:

*Specifying gating*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A GatingMechanism is used to modulate the value of an `InputPort` or `InputPort`. An InputPort or OutputPort can
be specified for gating by assigning it a `GatingProjection` or `GatingSignal` anywhere that the Projections to a Port
or its `ModulatorySignals can be specified <State_Creation>`.  A `Mechanism <Mechanism>` can also be specified for
gating, in which case the `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>` of the specified Mechanism is used.  Ports
(and/or Mechanisms) can also be specified in the  **gate** argument of the constructor for a GatingMechanism. The
**gate** argument must be a list, each item of which must refer to one or more Ports (or the Mechanism(s) to which
they belong) to be gated by that GatingSignal.  The specification for each item in the list can use any of the forms
used to `specify a GatingSignal <GatingSignal_Specification>`.

.. _GatingMechanism_GatingSignals:

GatingSignals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A `GatingSignal` is created for each item listed in the **gate** argument of the constructor, and all of the
GatingSignals for a GatingMechanism are listed in its `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>` attribute.
Each GatingSignal is assigned one or more `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` to the InputPort(s) and/or
OutputPort(s) it gates. By default, the `function <GatingMechanism.function>` of GatingMechanism generates a `value
<GatingMechanism.value>` -- its `gating_allocation <GatingSignal.gating_allocation>` -- with a single item, that is
used by all of the GatingMechanism's GatingSignals.  However,  if a custom `function <GatingMechanism.function>` is
specified that generates a `gating_allocation <GatingSignal.gating_allocation>` with more than one item, different
GatingSignals can be assigned to the different items (see `GatingMechanism_Function` below).

.. _GatingMechanism_Modulation:

Modulation
^^^^^^^^^^

Each GatingMechanism has a `modulation <GatingSignal.modulation>` attribute, that provides a default for the way
in which its GatingSignals modulate the value of the Ports they gate (see `modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>`
for an explanation of how this attribute is specified and used to modulate the value of a Port).  Each GatingSignal
uses this value, unless its value is `individually specified <GatingSignal_Modulation>`.

.. _GatingMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _GatingMechanism_Input:

*Input*
~~~~~~~

The input to a GatingMechanism is determined in the same manner as the `input <ControlMechanism_Input>` to
any `ControlMechanism`.

.. _GatingMechanism_Function:

*Function*
~~~~~~~~~~

A GatingMechanism's `function <GatingMechanism.function>` is determined and operates in the same manner as the
`function <ControlMechanism_Function>` of any `ControlMechanism`.

.. _GatingMechanism_Output:

*Output*
~~~~~~~~

The OutputPorts of a GatingMechanism are `GatingSignals <GatingSignal>` (listed in its `gating_signals
<GatingMechanism.gating_signals>` attribute). It  has a `GatingSignal` for each `InputPort` and/or `OutputPort`
specified in the **gate** argument of its constructor, that sends a `GatingProjection` to those Ports.
The GatingSignals are listed in the `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>` attribute;  since they are a
type of `OutputPort`, they are also listed in the GatingMechanism's `output_ports <GatingMechanism.output_ports>`
attribute. The InputPorts and/or OutputPorts modulated by a GatingMechanism's GatingSignals can be displayed using
its `show <GatingMechanism.show>` method. If the GatingMechanism's `function <GatingMechanism.function>` generates a
`gating_allocation <GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>` with a single value (the default), then this is used as the
`allocation <GatingSignal.alloction>` for all of the GatingMechanism's `gating_signals
<GatingMechanism.gating_signals>`.  If the `gating_allocation <GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>` has multiple
items, and this is the same as the number of GatingSignals, then each GatingSignal is assigned the value of the
corresponding item in the `gating_allocation <GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>`.  If there is a different number of
`gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>` than the number of items in the `gating_allocation
<GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>`, then the `index <GatingSignal.index>` attribute of each GatingSignal must be
specified (e.g., in a `specification dictionary <GatingSignal_Specification>` in the **gating_signal** argument of
the GatingMechanism's constructor), or an error is generated.  The `default_allocation
<GatingMechanism.default_allocation>` attribute can be used to specify a  default allocation for GatingSignals that
have not been assigned their own `default_allocation  <GatingSignal.default_allocation>`. The `allocation
<GatingSignal.allocation>` is used by each GatingSignal to determine its `intensity  <GatingSignal.intensity>`,
which is then assigned to the `value <GatingProjection.value>` of the GatingSignal's `GatingProjection`.   The `value
<GatingProjection.value>` of the GatingProjection is used to modify the value of the InputPort and/or OutputPort it
gates (see `GatingSignal_Modulation` for description of how a GatingSignal modulates the value of a parameter).

.. _GatingMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

COMMENT:
    FIX 5/8/20: REWORK TO FOLLOW CONTROLMECHANISM
COMMENT

A GatingMechanism executes in the same way as a `ProcessingMechanism <ProcessingMechanism>`, based on its place in the
Composition's `graph <Composition.graph>`.  Because `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` are likely to introduce
cycles (recurrent connection loops) in the graph, the effects of a GatingMechanism and its projections will generally
not be applied in the first `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>` (see
COMMENT:
`Composition_Cycles_and_Feedback` and
COMMENT
**feedback** argument for the `add_projection <Composition.add_projection>`
method of `Composition` for a description of how to configure the initialization of feedback loops in a Composition;
also see `Scheduler` for a description of detailed ways in which a GatingMechanism and its dependents can be scheduled
to execute).

When executed, a GatingMechanism  uses its input to determine the value of its `gating_allocation
<GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>`, each item of which is used by a corresponding `GatingSignal` to determine its
`gating_signal <GatingSignal.gating_signal>` and assign to its `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>`. In the
subsequent `TRIAL <TimeScale.TRIAL>`, each GatingProjection's value is used by the Port to which it projects to
modulate the `value <Port_Base.value>` of that Port (see `modulation <ModulatorySignal_Modulation>` fon an explanation
of how the value of a Port is modulated).

.. note::
   A Port that receives a `GatingProjection` does not update its `value <Port_Base.value>` (and therefore does not
   reflect the influence of its `GatingSignal`) until that Port's owner Mechanism executes (see `Lazy Evaluation
   <Component_Lazy_Updating>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

    COMMENT

    Arguments
    ---------

    default_gating_allocation : value, list or ndarray : default `defaultGatingAllocation`
        the default value for each of the GatingMechanism's GatingSignals;
        its length must equal the number of items specified in the **gate** argument.

    input_shapes : int, list or 1d np.array of ints
        specifies default_gating_allocation as an array of zeros if **default_gating_allocation** is not passed as an
        argument;  if **default_gating_allocation** is specified, it takes precedence over the specification of **input_shapes**.
        As an example, the following mechanisms are equivalent::
            T1 = TransferMechanism(input_shapes = [3, 2])
            T2 = TransferMechanism(default_variable = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0]])

    monitor_for_gating : List[OutputPort or Mechanism] : default None
        specifies the `OutputPorts <OutputPort>` to be monitored by the `ObjectiveMechanism`, if specified in an
        **objective_mechanism** argument (see `ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism`), or directly by the
        GatingMechanism itself if **objective_mechanism** is not specified.  If any specification is a Mechanism
        (rather than its OutputPort), its `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` is used (see
        `ControlMechanism_Monitor_for_Control` for additional details).

    function : TransferFunction : default Linear(slope=1, intercept=0)
        specifies the function used to transform the GatingMechanism's `variable <GatingMechanism.variable>`
        to a `gating_allocation`.

    default_allocation : number, list or 1d array : None
        specifies the default_allocation of any `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating.signals>` for
        which the **default_allocation** was not specified in its constructor (see default_allocation
        <GatingMechanism.default_allocation>` for additional details).

    gate : list[GatingSignal, InputPort, OutputPort, Mechanism, tuple[str, Mechanism], or dict]
        specifies the `InputPorts <InputPort>` and/or `OutputPorts <OutputPorts>` to be gated by the
        GatingMechanism; the number of items must equal the length of the **default_gating_allocation**
        argument; if a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` is specified, its `primary InputPort <InputPort_Primary>`
        is used (see `GatingMechanism_GatingSignals` for details).

    modulation : str : MULTIPLICATIVE
        specifies the default form of modulation used by the GatingMechanism's `GatingSignals <GatingSignal>`,
        unless they are `individually specified <GatingSignal_Specification>`.

    params : Dict[param keyword: param value] : default None
        a `parameter dictionary <ParameterPort_Specification>` that can be used to specify the parameters
        for the Mechanism, parameters for its function, and/or a custom function and its parameters. Values
        specified for parameters in the dictionary override any assigned to those parameters in arguments of the
        constructor.

    name : str : default see `name <GatingMechanism.name>`
        specifies the name of the GatingMechanism.

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : default Mechanism.classPreferences
        specifies the `PreferenceSet` for the GatingMechanism; see `prefs <GatingMechanism.prefs>` for details.


    Attributes
    ----------

    variable : value, list or ndarray
        used as the input to the GatingMechanism's `function <GatingMechanism.function>`.  Its format is determined
        by the **default_gating_allocation** or **input_shapes** argument of the GatingMechanism's constructor (see above),
        and is the same format as its `gating_allocation <GatingMechanis.gating_allocation>` (unless a custom
        `function <GatingMechanism.function>` has been assigned).

    monitor_for_gating : List[OutputPort]
        each item is an `OutputPort` monitored by the GatingMechanism or its `objective_mechanism
        <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` if that is specified (see `ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism`);
        in the latter case, the list returned is ObjectiveMechanism's `monitor <ObjectiveMechanism.monitor>` attribute.

    function : TransferFunction
        determines the function used to transform the GatingMechanism's `variable <GatingMechanism.variable>`
        to a `gating_allocation`;  the default is an identity function that simply assigns
        `variable <GatingMechanism.variable>` as the `gating_allocation <GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>`.

    default_allocation : number, list or 1d array
        determines the default_allocation of any `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating.signals>` for
        which the **default_allocation** was not specified in its constructor;  if it is None (not specified)
        then the GatingSignal's parameters.allocation.default_value is used. See documentation for
        **default_allocation** argument of GatingSignal constructor for additional details.

    gating_allocation : 2d array
        each item is the value assigned as the `allocation <GatingSignal.allocation>` for the corresponding
        `GatingSignal` listed in the `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>` attribute;  the
        gating_allocation is the same as the GatingMechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute).

    gating_signals : ContentAddressableList[GatingSignal]
        list of `GatingSignals <GatingSignals>` for the GatingMechanism, each of which sends
        `GatingProjection(s) <GatingProjection>` to the `InputPort(s) <InputPort>` and/or `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`
        that it gates; same as GatingMechanism `output_ports <Mechanism_Base.output_ports>` attribute.

    gating_projections : List[GatingProjection]
        list of all of the `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>` assigned to the GatingMechanism's
        `GatingSignals <GatingSignal>` (i.e., listed in its `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>` attribute.

    value : scalar or 1d np.array of ints
        the result of the GatingMechanism's `function <GatingProjection.funtion>`;
        each item is the value assigned to the corresponding GatingSignal listed in `gating_signals
        <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>`, and used by each GatingSignal to generate the `gating_signal
        <GatingSignal.gating_signal>` assigned to its `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>`; same as the
        GatingMechanism's `gating_allocation <GatingMechanism.gating_allocation>` attribute. Default is a
        single item used by all of the `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>`.

    gating_allocation : scalar or 1d np.array of ints
        the result of the GatingMechanism's `function <Projection_Base.function>`;
        each item is the value assigned to the corresponding `GatingSignal` listed in `gating_signals
        <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>`, and used by each GatingSignal to generate the `gating_signal
        <GatingSignal.gating_signal>` assigned to its `GatingProjections <GatingProjection>`; same as the
        GatingMechanism's `value <GatingMechanism.value>` attribute. Default is a single item used by all of the
        `gating_signals <GatingMechanism.gating_signals>`.

    modulation : str
        the default form of modulation used by the GatingMechanism's `GatingSignals <GatingSignal>`,
        unless they are `individually specified <GatingSignal_Specification>`.

    name : str
        the name of the GatingMechanism; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a default
        is assigned by MechanismRegistry (see `Registry_Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the GatingMechanism; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see `Preferences`
        for details).
