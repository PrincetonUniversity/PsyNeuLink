.. _CompositionInterfaceMechanism_Overview:

Overview
--------

CompositionInterfaceMechanisms act as interfaces between a `Composition` and its inputs from and outputs to the
environment, or the Components of another Composition within which it is `nested <Composition_Nested>`.

.. technical_note::

    The CompositionInterfaceMechanism provides both a standard interface through which other Components can interact
    with the environment and/or Compositions, as well as a means of preserving the modularity of Compositions for
    `compilation <Composition_Compilation>`. By providing the standard Components for communication among `Mechanisms
    <Mechanism>` (`InputPorts <InputPort>` and `OutputPorts <OutputPort>`), Mechanisms (and/or other Compositions) that
    are `INPUT <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` of a Composition can receive inputs from the environment
    in the same way that any other Node receives inputs, from `afferent Projections <Mechanism_Base.afferents>` (in
    this case, the `input_CIM  <Composition.input_CIM>` of the Composition to which they belong);  and, similarly,
    Components that are `OUTPUT <NodeRole.OUTPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` of a Composition can either report their
    outputs to the Composition or, if they are in a `nested Composition <Composition_Nested>`, send their outputs to
    Nodes in an enclosing Composition just like any others, using `efferent Projections <Mechanism_Base.efferents>`.
    Similarly, for Compilation, they provide a standard interface through which to provide inputs to a Composition and
    for aggregating outputs that, again, maintain a standard interface to other Components (which may not be compiled).

.. _CompositionInterfaceMechanism_Creation:

Creation
--------

The following three CompositionInterfaceMechanisms are created and assigned automatically to a Composition when it is
constructed (and should never be constructed manually):  `input_CIM <Composition.input_CIM>`, `parameter_CIM
<Composition.parameter_CIM>` and `output_CIM <Composition.output_CIM>` (see `Composition_CIMs` for additional details).

.. _CompositionInterfaceMechanism_Structure:

Structure
---------

A CompositionInterfaceMechanisms has a set of `InputPort` / `OutputPort` pairs that its `function
<Mechanism_Base.function>` -- the `Identity` `Function` -- uses to transmit inputs to CompositionInterfaceMechanism
to its outputs.  These are listed in its `port_map  <CompositionInterfaceMechanism.port_map>` attribute, each entry
of which is a key designating the `Port` of the Component with which the CompositionInterfaceMechanism communicates
outside the Composition (i.e., from an `input_CIM <Composition.input_CIM>` receives an `afferent Projection
<Mechanism_Base.afferents>`, a `parameter_CIM <Composition.parameter_CIM>` receives a `modulatory projection
<ModulatoryProjections>`, or an `output_CIM <Composition.output_CIM>` sends an `efferent Projection
<Mechanism_Base.efferents>`), and the value of which is a tuple containing the corresponding (`InputPort`,
`OutputPort`) pair used to transmit the information to or from the CompositionInterfaceMechanism.
CompositionIntefaceMechanisms can be seen graphically using the `show_cim <ShowGraph.show_cim>` option of the
Composition's `show_graph <ShowGraph.show_graph>` method (see figure below).

.. figure:: _static/CIM_figure.svg

   **Examples of Projections to nested Compositions routed through CompositionInterfaceMechanisms.**  *Panel A:*
   Simple example showing a basic configuration.  *Panel B:*  More complex configuration, generated from script below,
   showing Projections automatically created from the Node of an outer Composition (*X*) to two `INPUT
   <NodeRole.INPUT>` `Nodes <Composition_Nodes>` of a `nested Composition <Composition_Nested>`, a `ControlProjection`
   from a `ControlMechanism` in the outer Composition to a Node it modulates in the nested one, and from a `PROBE
   <NodeRole.PROBE>` Node (*B*) in the nested Composition to the `ControlMechanism` that monitors it. ::

    A = ProcessingMechanism(name='A')
    B = ProcessingMechanism(name='B')
    C = ProcessingMechanism(name='C')
    D = ProcessingMechanism(name='D')
    E = ProcessingMechanism(name='E')
    F = ProcessingMechanism(name='F')
    nested_comp = Composition(pathways=[[A,B,C], [D,E,F]], name='NESTED COMPOSITION')
    X = ProcessingMechanism(name='INPUT NODE')
    Y = ProcessingMechanism(name='OUTPUT NODE')
    C = ControlMechanism(name='CONTROL MECHANISM',
                         monitor_for_control=B,
                         control=("slope", E))
    outer_comp = Composition(name='OUTER COMPOSITION', pathways=[X, nested_comp, Y, C])
    outer_comp.show_graph(show_cim=NESTED, show_node_structure=True)

.. _CompositionInterfaceMechanism_Execution:

Execution
---------

A CompositionInterface Mechanism is executed when the Composition to which it belongs is executed, and shown never
be executed manually.
