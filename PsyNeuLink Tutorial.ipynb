It decreases the overhead required for cognitive modeling by providing standard building blocks (DDMS, Neural Nets, etc.) and the means to connect them together in a single environment. PsyNeuLink is designed to make the user think about computation in a \"mind/brain-like\" way while imposing minimal constraint on the type of models that can be implemented."

For now, clone the devel branch rather than the master branch. You can switch branches by pressing the \"branch: master\" dropdown menu on the left side of the page. Then download the package with the green \"Clone or download\" button on the right side of the page and \"Download ZIP.\" Open the version of this Tutorial in the cloned folder before continuing on.\n",
