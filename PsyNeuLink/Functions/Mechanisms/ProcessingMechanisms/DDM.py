.. _DDM_Overview:

Overview
--------

The DDM mechanism implements the "Drift Diffusion Model" (also know as the Diffusion Decision, Accumulation to Bound,
Linear Integrator, and Wiener Process First Passage Time Model [REFS]). This corresponds to a continuous version of
the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT [REF]), which is the statistically optimal procedure for two alternative
forced choice (TAFC) decision making ([REF]).  The DDM mechanism implements three versions of the process: two
analytic solutions (that operate at the :keyword:`TRIAL` time scale) and return an expected mean response time and
accuracy (:keyword:`BogaczEtAl` and :keyword:`NavarroAndFuss`); and one that numerically integrates the path
of the decision variable (at the in :keyword:`TIME_STEP` time scale).

.. _DDM_Creating_A_DDM_Mechanism:

Creating a DDM Mechanism
-----------------------------

A DDM Mechanism can be instantiated either directly, by calling the class, or using the :class:`mechanism`
function and specifying DDM as its ``mech_spec`` argument.  The analytic solution to use in :keyword:`TRIAL` mode
can be selected using the ``function`` argument, and the parameters of the process can be specified using the
argument corresponding to each (see Execution below).  The process used is specified with the ``function`` argument,
which can be simply the name of a DDM function (first example below), or a call to the function that can
include arguments specifying the function's parameters as well as a :doc:`ControlSignal` (second example)::

    my_DDM = DDM(function=BogaczEtAL)
    my_DDM = DDM(function=BogaczEtAl(drift_rate=0.2, threshold=(1, ControlSignal))

The input to a DDM mechanism can be a single scalar value or an an array (list or 1d np.array). If it is a single value,
a single DDM process is implemented, and the input is used as the ``drift_rate`` parameter (see below).  If the input is
an array, multiple parallel DDM processes are implemented all of which use the same parameters but each of which
receives its own input (from the corresponding element of the input array) and is executed independently of the others.


.. _DDM_Execution:

Execution
---------

When a DDM mechanism is executed it computes the decision process, either analytically (in :keyword:`TRIAL` mode)
or by step-wise integration (in :keyword:`TIME_STEP` mode).  As noted above, if the input is a single scalar value,
it computes a single DDM process.  If the input is an array, then multiple parallel DDM processs are implemented,
and each element of the input is used for the corresponding DDM process (all use the same set of parameters;
to implement processs that use their own parameters, a separate DDM mechanism should be created for each).

The parameters of the DDM process can be specified as arguments for either of the functions used for
:keyword:`TRIAL` mode (i.e., an analytic solution).  For :keyword:`TIME_STEP` mode (step-wise integration),
parameters must be specified in the ``params`` dict argument for the mechanism, using the keywords below:

* :keyword:`DRIFT_RATE` (default 0.0).
  - multiplies the input to the mechanism before it is assigned to the ``variable`` on every call of ``function``.
  The product is further multiplied by the value received from any ControlSignal projections to the
  ``DRIFT_RATE` parameterState.  The ``drift_rate`` parameter can be thought of as the "automatic" component
  (baseline strength) of the decision process, and the value received from a ControlSignal projection as the
  "attentional" component, both of which multiplicatively scale the input which constitutes the "stimulus" component.

* :keyword:`STARTING_POINT` (default 0.0).
  - specifies the initial value of the decision variable.  If ``time_scale`` is :keyword:`TimeScale.TIME_STEP`
  the ``starting_point`` is added to the decision variable on the first call to ``function`` but not subsequently.

* :keyword:`THRESHOLD` (default 1.0)
  - specifies the stopping value for the decision process.  When ``time_scale`` is :keyword:`TIME_STEP`, the
   integration process is terminated when the absolute value of the decision variable equals the absolute value
   of threshold.  The sign used to specify the threshold parameter determines the sign of the "correct response"
   (used for calculating error rate): if the value of the decision variable equals the value of the threshold,
   the result is coded as a correct response;  if the value of the decision  variable equals the negative of the
   threshold, the result is coded as an error.

* :keyword:`NOISE` (default 0.5)
   - specifies the variance of the stochastic ("diffusion") component of the decision process.  If ``time_scale``
   is :keyword:`TIME_STEP`, this value is multiplied by a random sample drawn from a zero-mean normal (Gaussian)
   distribution on every call of ``function``, and added to the decision variable.

* :keyword:`NON_DECISION_TIME` (default 200)
  specifies the ``t0`` parameter of the process;  when ``time_scale`` is :keyword:`TIME_STEP`, it is added to
  the number of time steps taken to complete the decision process (i.e., the response time).

.. note::
   DDM handles "runtime" parameters (specified in call to execute method) differently than standard Functions:
   any specified params are kept separate from paramsCurrent (Which are not overridden)
   if the FUNCTION_RUN_TIME_PARMS option is set, they are added to the current value of the
   corresponding ParameterState;  that is, they are combined additively with controlSignal output


Output values:

    - self.value (and values of outputStates) contain each outcome value (e.g., ER, DT, etc.)

    NOTE: RT value is "time-steps" assumed to represent ms (re: t0??)

    TRIAL MODE:
       **mean RT (all solutions)
       probability of crossing positive threshold (all solutions)
       variance of RT (NavarroAndFuss only)
       variance of ER (NavarroAndFuss only)

        * **result** to the mechanism's ``value`` attribute, the value of its ``RESULT`` outputState,
          and to the 1st item of the mechanism's ``outputValue`` attribute;
        ..
        * **mean** of the result to the value of the mechanism's ``RESULT_MEAN`` outputState and
          and to the 2nd item of the mechanism's ``outputValue`` attribute;
        ..
        * **variance** of the result to the value of the mechanism's ``RESULT_VARIANCE`` outputState and
          and to the 3rd item of the mechanism's ``outputValue`` attribute.

    TIME_STEP MODE:
        * at each time_step, value of decision variable
        * on completion: number of time_steps (RT)
        * ??variance of the path? (as confirmation of /deviation from noise param??)

COMMENT:
    ?? IS THIS TRUE, OR JUST A CARRYOVER FROM DDM??
    Notes:
    * DDM handles "runtime" parameters (specified in call to function) differently than standard functions:
        any specified params are kept separate from paramsCurrent (Which are not overridden)
        if the FUNCTION_RUN_TIME_PARMS option is set, they are added to the current value of the
            corresponding ParameterState;  that is, they are combined additively with controlSignal output

            DDM is a subclass Type of the Mechanism Category of the Function class
            It implements a Mechanism for several forms of the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) for
                two alternative forced choice (2AFC) decision making:
                - Bogacz et al. (2006) analytic solution (TimeScale.TRIAL mode -- see kwBogaczEtAl option below):
                    generates error rate (ER) and decision time (DT);
                    ER is used to stochastically generate a decision outcome (+ or - valued) on every run
                - Navarro and Fuss (2009) analytic solution (TImeScale.TRIAL mode -- see kwNavarrosAndFuss:
                    generates error rate (ER), decision time (DT) and their distributions;
                    ER is used to stochastically generate a decision outcome (+ or - valued) on every run
                - stepwise integrator that simulates each step of the integration process (TimeScale.TIME_STEP mode)

    function : IntegratorFunction : default BogaczEtAl
        specifies the analytic solution to use for the decision process if ``time_scale`` is set to TimeScale.TRIAL;
        can be :class:`BogaczEtAl` or :class:`NavarroAndFuss (note:  the latter requires that the MatLab engine is
        installed). If ``time_scale`` is set to TimeScale.TIME_STEP, ``function`` is automatically assigned to
        :class:`Integrator`.

    params : Optional[Dict[param keyword, param value]]
        dictionary that can be used to specify parameters of the mechanism, parameters of its function,
        and/or  a custom function and its parameters (see :doc:`Mechanism` for specification of a parms dict).

    time_scale :  TimeScale : TimeScale.TRIAL
        determines whether the mechanism is executed on the :keyword:`TIME_STEP` or :keyword:`TRIAL` time scale.
        This must be set to :keyword:`TimeScale.TRIAL` to use one of the analytic solutions specified by ``function``.
        This must be set to :keyword:`TimeScale.TIME_STEP` to numerically integrate the decision variable.

    name : str : default Transfer-[index]
        string used for the name of the mechanism.
        If not is specified, a default is assigned by MechanismRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).[LINK]

    prefs : Optional[PreferenceSet or specification dict : Process.classPreferences]
        preference set for process.
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using ``classPreferences`` defined in __init__.py
        (see Description under PreferenceSet for details) [LINK].

    .. context=functionType+kwInit):
            context : str : default ''None''
                   string used for contextualization of instantiation, hierarchical calls, executions, etc.

    function :  IntegratorFunction : default BogaczEtAl
        Determines method used to compute the outcome of the decision process when ``time_scale`` is
        :keyword:`TimeScale.TRIAL`.  If ``times_scale`` is :keyword:`TimeScale.TIME_STEP`, ``function``
        is automatically assigned to :class`Integrator`, and used to compute the decision process by
        stepwise integration of the decision variable (one step per ``CentralClock.time_step``).

    function_params : Dict[str, value]
        Contains one entry for each parameter of the mechanism's function.
        The key of each entry is the name of (keyword for) a function parameter, and its value is the parameter's value.

    value : value
        output of execute method.

    name : str : default DDM-[index]
        Name of the mechanism.
        Specified in the name argument of the call to create the projection;
        if not is specified, a default is assigned by MechanismRegistry
        (see :doc:`Registry` for conventions used in naming, including for default and duplicate names).[LINK]

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict : Mechanism.classPreferences
        Preference set for mechanism.
        Specified in the prefs argument of the call to create the mechanism;
        if it is not specified, a default is assigned using ``classPreferences`` defined in __init__.py
