.. _Purpose:

Purpose
-------

PsyNeuLink is an open-source, software environment written in Python, and designed for the needs of
neuroscientists, psychologists, computational psychiatrists and others interested in learning about and building
models of the relationship between brain function, mental processes and behavior.

PsyNeuLink can be used as a "block modeling environment", in which to construct, simulate, document, and exchange
computational models of neural mechanisms and/or psychological processes at the subsystem and system levels.
A block modeling environment allows components to be constructed that implement various, possibly disparate
functions, and then link them together into a system to examine how they interact.  In PsyNeuLink, components are
used to implement the function of brain subsystems and/or psychological processes, the interaction of which can then
be simulated at the system level.

The purpose of PsyNeuLink is to make it as easy as possible to create new and/or import existing models, and
integrate them to simluate system-level interactions.  It provides a suite of core components for
implementing models of various forms of processing, learning, and control, and its Library includes examples that
combine these components to implement published models.  As an open source project, its suite of components is meant
to be enhanced and extended, and its library is meant to provide an expanding repository of models, written in a
concise, executable, and easy to interpret form, that can be shared, compared, and extended by the scientific community.

*(Note: the PsyNeuLink development effort was initiated and named in 2016, entirely independently and without
awareness of Neuralink, with which it bears no association nor any intentional relationsip.)*

.. _What_PsyNeuLink_IS:

What PsyNeuLink **IS**
----------------------

It is:

 - *open source*, freeing users of the costs or restrictions associated with proprietary software.

 ..

 - *computationally general* -- it can be used to implement, seamlessly integrate, and simulate interactions among
   disparate components that vary in their granularity of representation and function (from individual neurons or
   neural populations to functional subsystems and abstract cognitive functions) and at any time scale of execution.

 ..

 - *integrative* -- it provides a standard and accessible environment suitable for model comparison, sharing, and
   documentation, as well the integration into "system-level" models of components responsible for disparate forms
   of computation (for example, a neural network capable of learning with components that rely on integration and/or
   settling dynamics for decision making).

 ..

 - *extensible* -- it has an interface (API) that allows it to be used with other powerful tools for implementing
   individual components, such as:

    * Neuron and Nengo (biophysically realistic models of neuronal function)
    * Emergent (broad class of neurally-plausible connectionist models);
    * Pytorch and TensorFlow (ODE's, deep learning);
    * ACT-R (symbolic, production system models).

.. note::
   PsyNeuLink is alpha software, that is still being actively developed.  Although it is useable, and most of the
   documented functionality is available, some features may not yet be fully implemented and/or subject to
   modification.  Please report any bugs and/or suggestions for development to psyneulinkhelp@princeton.edu.

.. _What_PsyNeuLink_is_NOT:

What PsyNeuLink is **NOT**
--------------------------

The longterm goal of PsyNeuLink is to provide an environment that integrates comptutational modeling of brain function
and behavior at all levels of analysis.  While it is designed to be fully general, and can in principle be used to
implement models at any level, it is still under development, and current efficiency considerations make it more
suitable for some of forms of modeling than others. In its present form, it is well suited to the creation of
simple to moderately complex models, and for the integration of disparate models into a single environment, and the
creation of systems-level neuroscientific models, as well as cognitive neuroscientific and modestly scaled machine
learning-style models, while in
it is presently less well suited to efforts involving massively large computations, such as:

 - large scale machine learning simulations
 - highly detailed biophysical models of neurons or neuronal populations

Other packages currently better suited to such applications are:
`Emergent <https://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page>`_ for biologically-inspired neural network models
`Pytorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ and `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org>`_ (for deep learning models);
`HDDM <http://ski.clps.brown.edu/hddm_docs/>`_ (for Drift Diffusion Models);
`ACT-R <http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu>`_ (for production system models);
`Genesis <http://www.genesis-sim.org>`_,
`Neuron <https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/>`_,
and `Nengo <http://www.nengo.ca>`_  (for biophysically-realistic models of neuronal function).

These packages are good for elaborate and detailed models of a particular form. In contrast, the focus in designing
PsyNeuLink has been to make it as flexible and easy to use as possible, with the ability to integrate components
constructed in other packages (including some of the ones listed above) into a single environment.  These are
characteristics that are often (at least in the initial stages of development) in tension with efficiency (think:
interpreted vs. compiled).

That said, priorities for ongoing development of PsyNeuLink are:
    i) acceleration, using just-in-time compilation methods and parallelization
       (see `Compilation`, and `Vesely et al., 2022 <http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/abhishek/jvesely-cgo22.pdf>`_);
    ii) enhancement of the API to facilitate wrapping modules from other packages for integration into the PsyNeuLink
        environment (examples currently exist for `Pytorch <https://pytorch.org>`_ ) and translating into a standard
        `Model Description Format (MDF) <https://github.com/ModECI/MDF>`_;
    iii) integration of tools for parameter estimation, model comparison and data fitting
         (see `ParameterEstimationComposition`); and
    iv) a graphic interface for the construction of models and realtime display of their execution
        (see `PsyNeuLinkView <http://www.psyneuln.deptcpanel.princeton.edu/psyneulink-view-2/>`_).

PsyNeuLink is written in Python, and conforms to the syntax, coding standards and modular organization shared by
most Python packages.  `BasicsAndPrimer` provides an orientation to PsyNeuLink's Components, some examples of what
PsyNeuLink models look like, and some of its capabilities. `QuickReference` provides an overview of how PsyNeuLink is
organized and some of its basic principles of operation.  The `Tutorial <Tutorial>` provides an interactive guide to the
construction of models using PsyNeuLink.  `Core` contains the fundamental objects used to build PsyNeuLink models, and
`Library` contains extensions, including speciality components, implemented compositions, and published models.
